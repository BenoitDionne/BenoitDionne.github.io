<h2> Fractal Geometry </h2>

<p> The following figure is the famous Sierpinski Gasket. </p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="sierpinski.png" style="width: 400px"
       alt="Image of Sierpinski Gasket" class="framed">
</div>

<p> It is a typical example of a fractal object.  We define in the
  section on <a href="fractal2_en.html#fractal_objects">
    fractal dimensions </a> on the next page what is a fractal object.
  We do not need this definition right now. </p>

<p> To store this figure on a computer, we need 24235 bytes (png
  format).  Using some simple mathematical technique (namely <em>
  Iterative Functions Systems (IFS) </em>), this figure (to any level
  of accuracy) can be stored using only 552 bytes (a simple Matlab
  code). </p>

<p> The traditional way to save a (black and white) figure is to store
  on the computer the information for each pixel of the figure.  In
  the next section, we explain how to create (draw) the Sierpinski
  Gasket and how to stored it. </p>

<p> Basically, the IFS technique used to create the Sierpinski Gasket
  can be used to create other images.   We illustrate in the next
  sections how IFS can be used to generate different images. </p>

<h3> Sierpinski Gasket </h3>

<h4> Iterative Function System </h4>

<p> The Sierpinski Gasket can be generated using a simple iterative
  procedure that we now describe.</p>

<ul>
<li>
First, chose any set of points in a square: a line, a triangle,
... are fine. </li>
<li> Second, shrink the original square to half its size. </li>
<li> Third, draw back into the original square three copies of the
  shrunk square as illustrated in the following figures. <br>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="center">
  <img src="step_one_en.png" class="framed" style="width: 400px"
       alt="First iteration to produce a Sierpinski gasket">
</div>

<p> We repeat the second and third steps above as many times as we
  want (until we are happy with the figure we get).  The next figure
  is the second iteration of the second and third steps of the IFS
  described above. </p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="step_two_en.png" class="framed" style="width: 400px"
       alt="Second iteration to produce a Sierpinski gasket">
</div>

<p> Independently of the set of points that you choose at the
  beginning, you always get the Sierpinski triangle. </p>

<p> In the following application, you may select one of the three
  initial figures proposed, and the number of iterations to be
  performed.  Use only a small number of iterations, no more
  than 20, to avoid exceeding the accuracy of your display. </p>

<div class="center">
<canvas id="SRPK" width="400" height="400">
</canvas>
</div>

<ul>
  <li> Number of iterations: <input type="text" value="5" id="nbrSRPK"> </li>
  <li> Initial figure: <select id="initSRPK">
      <option value="0" selected> triangle </option>
      <option value="1"> square </option>
      <option value="2"> lozenge </option>
  </select> </li>
  <li> <input type="button" value="Start" onclick="iterateSRPK2()"> </li>
  <li> <input type="button" value="Clear" onclick="clearIFS('SRPK')"> </li>
</ul>

<p> Instead of storing on the computer all the pixels of the figure of
  the Sierpinski triangle, we only have to store on the computer
  (using mathematical formulae) the second and third steps of the IFS
  described above. </p>

<p> The Sierpinski triangle on the unit square is generated by the
  following three functions.  They shrink the unit square to a square
  where the sides have length 1/2, and map the shrunk square back into
  the unit square as described above. </p>

<ul>
<li> First function:<br>
  <em class="Equations">
    &nbsp; X = x/2 <br>
    &nbsp; Y = y/2 + 1/2
  </em>
</li>
<li> Second function: <br>
  <em class="Equations">
    &nbsp; X = x/2 + 1/2 <br>
    &nbsp; Y = y/2
  </em>
</li>
<li> Third function: <br>
  <em class="Equations">
    &nbsp; X = x/2 <br>
    &nbsp; Y = y/2
  </em>
</li>
</ul>

<p> There is a mathematical theorem that explains why the IFS for the
  Sierpinski triangle always generate the same image independently of
  the initial set that has been chosen.  In fact, each IFS generates
  only one image.  This theorem is called the <en> Fixed Point
  Theorem </em>.  This theorem can easily be understood in the context
  of the simple IFS defined by the <em> logistic mapping </em> that
  can be found in the <a href="fractal3_en.html#logistic"> following
  pages </a>.</p>

<p> <em> Question </em>: What happen if the second function also
  rotate the square by 90 degrees? </p>

<h4> Probabilistic System </h4>

<p> There is a simple technique to illustrate the Sierpinski
  gasket. Let A the point with coordinate (0,1), B the point with
  coordinate (1,0) and C the origin (see the figure below).  Suppose
  that we have an unbiased dice and that 1,6 are associated to A, 2,5
  are associated to B and 3,4 are associated to C. </p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="probability.png" class="framed" style="width: 300px"
       alt="A few iterations of the probabislitic IFS to produce the Sierpinski gasket">
</div>

<ul>
<li> Choose any point <em class="Equations">x0</em> in the plane. </li>
<li> Throw the dice.  Suppose that you get a 3. </li>
<li> The point <em class="Equations">x1</em> is the middle of the line
  between <em class="Equations">x0</em> and C. </li>
<li> Throw the dice.  Suppose that you get a 1. </li>
<li> The point <em class="Equations">x2</em> is the middle of the line
  between <em class="Equations">x1</em> and A. </li>
<li> And so on. </li>
</ul>

<p> The isolated points are invisible.  We only see the cluster of
  points.  This cluster of points shadows the Sierpinski gasket. To
  get a good approximation of the Sierpinski gasket, the number of
  iterations must be very large and the random number generator of
  your computer must be really ... really good (is it?). </p>

<p>
<em> Question </em>: Which are the points that constitute (make up)
the Sierpinski gasket? <br> <em> Question </em>: What happen if the
dice is biased (loaded)? </p>

<p> Good references (for advanced undergraduate students in
  mathematics) are <em> Fractals Everywhere </em> by Micheal Barnsley
  (Academic press, 1988) and <em> Chaos and Fractals </em> by
  H.-O. Peitgen, H. J&uuml;rgens and D. Saupe (Springer-Verlag,
  1992). </p>
