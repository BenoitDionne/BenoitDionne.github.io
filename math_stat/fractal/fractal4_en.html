<h3> Mandelbrot and Julia Sets </h3>

<p> We cannot end our little introduction to iterative function
  systems without mentioning the figure that started all the
  excitement about computer generated fractal images; namely, the <em>
  Mandelbrot set </em>. </p>

<p> In the previous page, we have presented some properties of the
  logistic mapping.  More precisely, we have looked at the iterations
  of the real valued function</p>

<center>
<em class="Equations_Display">
f<sub>&micro;</sub>(x) = &micro; x ( 1- x)
</em>
</center>

<p>for some values of <em class="Equations">&micro;</em>.  The logical
  next step is to consider the iterations of functions from the plane
  to the plane as we have done for IFS's.  If we identify the real
  plane to the complex plane, functions of the real plane into itself
  can be seen as complex valued functions defined on the complex
  plane. </p>

<p> The <em> Julia sets </em> are generated by iterations of the
  simple complex valued functions defined by </p>

<center>
<em class="Equations_Display">
f<sub>c</sub>(z) = z<sup>2</sup> + c &nbsp; ,
</em>
</center>

<p>where <em class="Equations">c</em> and <em class="Equations">z</em>
  are complex numbers.  More precisely, given
  <em class="Equations">c</em>, let <em class="Equations">M</em> be the
  set of all points <em class="Equations">z</em> in the complex plane
  such that the sequence</p>

<center>
<em class="Equations_Display"> z<sub>o</sub> = z, &nbsp;
z<sub>1</sub> = f<sub>c</sub>(z<sub>o</sub>), &nbsp;
z<sub>2</sub> = f<sub>c</sub>(z<sub>1</sub>), &nbsp;
z<sub>3</sub> = f<sub>c</sub>(z<sub>2</sub>), ...
</em>
</center>

<p>is unbounded.  The <em>Julia Set</em> associated to
  <em class="Equations">c</em> is the boundary of
  <em class="Equations">M</em>. </p>

<p> If a point of the iteration starting with
  <em class="Equations">z<sub>o</sub> = z</em> goes outside the circle
  of radius <em class="Equations">r = max{|c|,2}</em> centred at the
  origin, then the iteration gives an unbounded sequence.  Therefore,
  <em class="Equations">z</em> is in <em class="Equations">M</em>.
  Based on this property, we say that a point
  <em class="Equations">z</em> doesn't belong to
  <em class="Equations">M</em> if after a chosen number of iterations,
  the sequence of iterations is still inside the circle of radius
  <em class="Equations">r</em> centred at the origin.  If you
  choose a large number of iterations, you theoretically get a more
  accurate image of the Julia set.  Obviously, the quality of the
  picture is limited by the number of pixels on the display of your
  computer.   In particular, if <em class="Equations">M</em> is
  <q lang="EN">highly</q> disconnected (formed of many little pieces),
  choosing a large number of iterations may produce an empty image if
  most of the points in <em class="Equations">M</em> aren't associated
  to pixels on your screen. </p>

<p>You can use the application below to draw some Julia sets.  Given a
  value for <em class="Equations">c</em>, the points of the complex
  plane coloured in black are the points <em class="Equations">z</em>
  for which the above sequence is bounded.  The boundary of the area
  in black is therefore the <em> Julia set </em> associated
  to <em class="Equations">c</em>. </p>

<div class="center">
<canvas id="julia" width="400" height="400">
</canvas>
</div>

<ul>
  <li> <em class="Equations">Real(c) = </em>
    <input type="text" value="0.27" id="c_real"> </li>
  <li> <em class="Equations">Im(c) = </em>
    <input type="text" value="-0.48" id="c_img"> </li>
  <li> Number of iterations <input type="text" value="50" id="julia_nbr">
  </li>
  <li> <input type="button" value="Start" onclick="julia()">
  </li>
  <li> <input type="button" value="Clear" onclick="clearDDS('julia')"> </li>
</ul>

<p> The <em> Mandelbrot set </em> is set of all points
  <em class="Equations">c</em> in the complex plane such that the
  following sequence is bounded. </p>

<center>
<em class="Equations_Display">
c, &nbsp; c^2 + c, &nbsp; (c^2 + c)^2 + c,
&nbsp; ((c^2 + c)^2 + c)^2 + c, ...
</em>
</center>

<p> The following application can be used to display the Mandelbrot
  set.  The points in black form the Mandelbrot set.</p>

<div class="center">
<canvas id="mandelbrot" width="400" height="400"> </canvas>
</div>

<ul>
  <li> Number of iterations <input type="text" value="200"
				   id="mandelbrot_nbr"> </li>
  <li> <input type="button" value="Start" onclick="mandelbrot()">
  </li>
  <li> <input type="button" value="Clear" onclick="clearDDS('mandelbrot')">
  </li>
</ul>

<p> If a point of the iteration goes outside the circle of radius
  <em class="Equations">r</em> defined above, then the sequence
  <em class="Equations"> c, c^2 + c, c^2 + c)^2 + c,
    ((c^2 + c)^2 + c)^2 + c, ... </em> is unbounded.  Therefore,
  this value of <em class="Equations">c</em> isn't in the Mandelbrot
  set.  As for the Julia sets, this is the rule that we have
  implemented in the application above. </p>

<div class="LOOK">
<p> You may zoom in on a region of the Mandelbrot set by clicking with
  your mouse in the region of interest in the figure. </p>

<p> You can also produce the Julia set associated to a value of the
  Mandelbrot set by clicking with your mouse on the point of
  interest in the Mandelbrot set when holding the <em>Alt</em>
  key.  The associated Julia set is displayed in the window for the
  Julia sets Application above.</p>
</div>

<p> The Mandelbrot set is also called the <em> gingerbread man </em>.
  The Mandelbrot set looks like a gingerbread man cookie, doesn't it?
  If you zoom in judiciously, you will see smaller and smaller
  gingerbread men.  This is comparable to the self similarity that we
  have observed in the images generated by IFS's. </p>

<p> There is a beautiful relation between the Mandelbrot set and the
  Julia sets.  The Mandelbrot set is the set of all points
  <em class="Equations">c</em> that produce a connected Julia
  sets (the set can be drawn without lifting the pen though it may
  take you an infinite among of time to draw it). </p>

<p> There are many fascinating mathematical questions that came up
  from the study of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets.  Many of
  them are still unsolved. </p>
