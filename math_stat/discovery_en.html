<h3> Fractal Geometry </h3>

<p> The word <em> Fractal </em> is now part of our
ordinary vocabulary just as <em> table </em> and
<em> chair </em> are.  The word "fractal" has
appeared in the scripts of many films and television shows in the
recent years. But beyond entertainment, there are beautiful and
profound mathematical concepts associated with fractal geometry.
The website starting with the page
<script language="javascript">
buildLinK(fractal1.url_en, fractal1.text_en,"MMathSStat", fractal1.id,
fractal1.target);
</script>
introduces the important ideas behind the pictures. </p>

<a name="GEOMCTR"> <h4> Hyperbolic Geometry </h4> </a>

<p> You have learned Euclidean geometry in high school but have you
heard about hyperbolic geometry?  You can draw a
<script language="javascript">
buildLinK(geomCenter.url_en, geomCenter.text_en,"MMathSStat", geomCenter.id,
geomCenter.target);
</script> (the Poincar&eacute; disc) and observe how the angles and area
change as you move the vertices of the triangle. (This application is
in Java, so make sure that your browser is properly configured
before loading it.)

<a name="LINALG"> <h4> Linear Algebra </h4> </a>

<p> Dr. Joseph Khoury of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics
has created a beautiful website on
<script language="javascript">
buildLinK(linAlgbr.url_en, linAlgbr.text_en,"MMathSStat",
linAlgbr.id, linAlgbr.target);
</script> which is accessible to any one with a first year Linear
Algebra course.  In addition to explanations of basic concepts of
Linear Algebra, there are also many real life applications of Linear
Algebra. </p>

<a name="NUMERIC"> <h4> Numerical Analysis </h4> </a>

<p> Olivier Rousseau is working with Yves Bourgault on the
<em> Human Visualization Project </em> whose goals
is to numerically reproduce some human functions and organs.  For more
information about this project and about Olivier's work in particular,
please visit
<script language="javascript">
buildLinK(humanNumber.url_en, humanNumber.text_en,"MMathSStat",
"human_nbrs", humanNumber.target);
