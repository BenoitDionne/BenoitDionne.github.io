<h2> Mathematics and Statistics </h2>

<p> Mathematics and statistics are not only powerful problem-solving
tools, but also highly creative fields of studies that combine 
precision with intuition, and imagination with logic. </p>

<p> Mathematics is much more than numbers! Its basic goal is to reveal
general patterns that explain our world: these can appear in
electrical impulses of the human nervous system, in the evolution of
animal populations in their habitats, or in fluctuations in
stock-market prices.  Mathematics is at the centre of science and
engineering and reaches beyond into medicine, business and the social
sciences.</p>

<p> Advances in mathematics and statistics lie behind many discoveries
that are now part of our daily lives, such as MRI scanners, digital 
compression of music and video, secure electronic communications,
data mining, genomic algorithms, stock market pricing, video games and
more.  Where there is technology, there is mathematics. </p>

<p> To study mathematics, you have to love the subject and appreciate
its beauty.  It is a fascinating subject to study.  Mathematics,
music, literature and a few other subjects are the fundamental blocks
of human knowledge, the product of thousands of years of
civilisation. </p>

<p> In this section of the website, we introduce some of the beautiful
fields of mathematics and hopefully teach you some mathematics in the
process, we look at the impact of mathematics in our life and at the
jobs that people with a degree in mathematics or statistics do,
etc. </p>

<p> Our intention in this section of the website is to give you many
reasons to study mathematics and to seriously consider a career in one
of the fascinating fields of mathematics and statistics. </p>
