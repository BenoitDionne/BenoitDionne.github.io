</ul>

<h3 id="Q1">Where can I buy the license to access Möbius?</h3>

<p> The first time that you do an online assignment, you will be
  asked to buy the license to use Möbius.  Here are the
  <script language="javascript"> 
    buildLinK("https://digitaled.com/support/help/student/Content/STUD-ENROLL-REGISTER/License-within-Mobius.htm",
    "instructions", "MMathSStat", "webstore", "_blank");
  </script> to purchase the license.  Though not compulsory, it is
  suggested to use your <em>@uottawa.ca</em> email on the
  registration form. </p>

<p> The license is valid for three terms including the session that
  you buy the license.  So, you may use it for more than one MAT
  course. </p>

<h3 id="Q15"> What should I do if I always get an error message when I try to
buy the license using PayPal? </h3>

<p> First and foremost, your first assignment must open in a new tab of
  your browser after you click on the link for the assignment in
  BrightSpace.  If the assignment open inside BrightSpace, you should
  tell your instructor to modify the link so that the assignment open
  in a new tab. </p>

<p> If you still get error an message or are timed out when trying to pay
  your license, you must: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Make sure that you use a supported browser like Firefox or
    chrome. </li>
  <li> Make sure that your browser accepts third party cookies.  For
    more information on this subject and on other issues that may cause
    problems, consult the website
    <script language="javascript"> 
      buildLinK("https://www.digitaled.com/support/help/student/Content/STUD-GEN-FUNCTIONS/Access-using-LMS.htm",
      "Access Using an LMS", "MMathSStat", "accessLMS", "_blank");
    </script>. </li>
  <li> Make sure that your browser accepts popups. </li>
</ul>

<p> The most frequent problem lately is about the <em>country of
    residence</em> when paying the license with a credit or debit
  card.  The country of residence is the country where you got your
  card.  Despite selecting the write country, you may still get an
  error message.  The problem is that PayPal is not very good in
  geography.  Even a country like France (that everybody should have
  heard about) may not be recognized by PayPal.  In that case, you
  should select <em>USA-other<em>.</p> 

<p> If after all that you still cannot buy the license using PayPal, use
  <em> Ask the Möbi chatbot </em> on the website
  <script language="javascript"> 
    buildLinK("https://www.digitaled.com/support/help/student/Content/Students-Home.htm",
    "Möbius Students", "MMathSStat", "MobStud", "_blank");
  </script>.  If the <em> Möbi chatbot</em> cannot answer your
  question, then you will have the option to forward it to the
  <em>DigitalEd support team</em>.
  <!-- <script language="javascript"> 
    buildLinK("mailto:support@digitaled.com",
    "DigitalEd support team", "MMathSStat", "support", "_blank");
  </script> and explain your problem to them.  Include with your
  email a screenshot of the error message that you get.
  -->
</p>

<h3 id="Q2">What should I do if I always get the Möbius login page when I
  click on a link for an assignment in BrightSpace? </h3>

<ul>
  <li> You must verify that the links to Möbius assignments in
    BrightSpace open in new tabs of your browser when you click on 
    them.  If they don't, ask your instructors to make it so. </li>
  <li> Your browser must allow third party cookies as explained in the
    question
    <script language="javascript"> 
      buildLinK("#Q15", "What should I do if I always get an error message when I try to buy the license using PayPal?",
      "MMathSStat", "Q15b", "_top");
    </script>.</li>
  <li> Some browsers don't respect the standards like Safari on Mac's
    computers.  We strongly suggest to use Firefox or Chrome. </li>
  <li> You must clear old cookies from Möbius and DigitalEd before
    trying again to access Möbius assignments through the links in
    BrightSpace. </li>
</ul>

<p>If you still have the same problem having doing all that, then you
  should use <em> Ask the Möbi chatbot </em> on the website
  <script language="javascript"> 
    buildLinK("https://www.digitaled.com/support/help/student/Content/Students-Home.htm",
    "Möbius Students", "MMathSStat", "MobStud", "_blank");
  </script>.  If the <em> Möbi chatbot</em> cannot answer your
  question, then you will have the option to forward it to the
  <em>DigitalEd support team</em>. </p>

<!--
<h3>I already have an active account on Möbius, what do I do?</h3>

<p>If the email address in your profile on Möbius is
  exactly your <em>@uottawa.ca</em> email address (lower and upper
  case letters included), you have nothing to do and you can access
  your assignments from the links on BrightSpace.</p> 

<p><em style="font-size: 120%;">If the email address in your profile
    on Möbius <em>is not exactly</em> your <em>@uottawa.ca</em> email
    address</em>, you must log in to your account on the site
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mobius_site.url_en, Mobius_site.url_en, "MMathSStat",
    Mobius_site.id, Mobius_site.target);
  </script> and change your email address to your
  exact <em>@uottawa.ca</em> email address.  After that,
  you <em>MUST</em> access your assignments from the links on
  BrightSpace.   You no longer have to go back to your Möbius
  account. </p>
-->

<h3 id="Q16">What should I do if all the instructions in Möbius are
  in a language other than English (the language that I want)?</h3>

<p> There are simpler solutions to solve this issue than
  learning that new language.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li> We assume that you are using the latest version of you operating
  system and browser. </li>
<li> First of all, check the setting of your computer and your browser
  to make sure that <em>English (CA)</em> or <em>English (US)</em> has
  been selected as the preferred language.  Möbius uses this
  information to select the language used to display the
  instructions. </li>
<li> Sometime, it suffices to restart your browser and remove the old
  cookies associated to Möbius and DigitalEd. </li>
<li> If, after the previous two steps, you are still in the small
  group that still get the instructions in a language other than
  English, try with another browser (still one of Firefox or Chrome).  
  If everything is fine with the second browser, then there may be a
  problem with your first browser.  It may be simpler to reinstall it
  than to try to pin point the issue.  If you still get the
  instructions in another language with the second browser, then the
  issue is more at the operating system level.  You should ask someone
  with a lot of expertise in managing the type of operating system
  that you are using to help you.</li>
<li> You may also use <em> Ask the Möbi chatbot </em> on the website
  <script language="javascript"> 
    buildLinK("https://www.digitaled.com/support/help/student/Content/Students-Home.htm",
    "Möbius Students", "MMathSStat", "MobStud", "_blank");
  </script>.  If the <em> Möbi chatbot</em> cannot answer your
  question, then you will have the option to forward it to the
  <em>DigitalEd support team</em>.
  <!-- <script language="javascript"> 
    buildLinK("mailto:support@digitaled.com",
    "DigitalEd support team", "MMathSStat", "support", "_blank");
  </script> -->
  They may have other suggestions to solve your problem.  They may be
  aware of some bugs in the version of your browser, ... </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Q4">What should I do when my grades are not recorded on
  BrightSpace? </h3>

<div class="LOOK" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%"> You must
  always access your assignments using the links in
  BrightSpace. </div>

<p> If you fail to do so, your grades will not be recorded in
  BrightSpace.  You <em style="font-size: 120%;">must not</em>
  navigate to the course home page on Möbius to access your
  assignments.  Your instructor may refuse to transfer grades from
  Möbius to BrightSpace and may consider that the assignments have not
  been submitted if you don't follow these instructions. </p>

<h3 id="Q5">What do I do when I get an authorization error or other similar
  errors?</h3>

<p> If you get such errors, the usual solution is to remove old
  cookies associated to Möbius and try again to reach the
  assignment.</p>

<h3 id="Q7">Where can I find the due date and instructions for an assignment
  on Möbius?</h3>

<p> The due date and rules (called <q lang="EN">policies</q>
  on Möbius) for each assignment is shown on the first page when you
  select an assignment.</p>

<p> The period of accessibility give you the starting date and the due
  date for the assignment.  You cannot work on the assignment outside
  this period.  It is your responsibility to carefully read this
  information.</p>

<p> On some assignments, you may be given more than one trial at the
  entire assignment.  That is, you may be able to submit your assignment
  early, learn your grade, and request a new version of the assignment
  to try to do better.  The questions for the newest version of the
  assignment will be slightly different than those for the previous
  versions of the assignment. </p>

<p> Unless otherwise stated in the instructions, if more than one
  attempt is allowed for an assignment, the policy is to take the
  best mark of all the attempts as the grade for the assignment. </p>

<div class="LOOK" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%">
  Please note that the access to the Möbius server will probably be
  slower during peak times (such as a few hours before the deadline to
  submit an assignment); plan ahead to avoid frustration. </div>

<h3 id="Q10">How do I know if I submitted an assignment?</h3>

<p> After submitting your assignment, you will get a message that your
  data have been saved.</p>

<div class="LOOK" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%">
  Any active assignment, that has not been submitted when the deadline
  to submit the assignment is reached, is automatically submitted.
</div>

<h3 id="Q11">How do I check my grade? How do I get the solutions?</h3>  

<p> To gain access to the <em>GradeBook</em> on Möbius, click on the
  link <em>GradeBook</em> in the module on BrightSpace where you can
  find your assignments.</p> 

<p> Next, request the list of all the assignments <em>1</em> and
  choose the assignments <em>2</em> whose grades and solutions you
  want.  For the assignments selected, you may ask for the version for
  which you got the highest mark or all the versions that you have
  attempted <em>3</em>.  You may request only the versions that you
  have completed <em>4</em>.</p>

<div class="center">

       alt="Image of the menu to select the assignments that you want to look at."
       style="height: 450px;" class="MobiusFig">
</div>

<p> When you have selected the options that you wanted, you only have
  to click the <em>Search button</em> at the bottom of the page. </p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="gradebook_3.png"
       alt="Image of the search button."
       style="height: 50px;" class="MobiusFig">
</div>

<p> The list of all the assignments that you have requested appears in
  the section <em>View Panel</em> at the bottom of the menu of the
  figure above.  To see the detailed solutions of an assignment, you
  only have to click on the link <em>Details</em> on the right of the
  title of the assignment.  According to the instructor's choice, this
  link may not be available before the deadline to submit the
  assignment. </p>

<p> If you are allowed to access the detailed solutions of your
  assignments, you will get a display that looks like the
  following. </p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="gradebook_4.png"
       alt="Image of the detailed solutions of an assignment."
       style="height: 450px;" class="MobiusFig">
</div>

<h3 id="Q8">How did I do?</h3>

<p> On some assignments, the <em>how did I do?</em> button (on the top
  left corner of a question) will be enabled.  When you click on it,
  you are told if your answer is correct or not.  There is no penalty
  associated with the use of this option (in fact, you are encouraged
  to use it when available).  For some assignments, there may be a cap
  on the number of times that you can use this option.  On others, you
  may use this option as many times as you want.</p>

<h3 id="Q12">Can I trust the equation editor to write my answer?</h3>

<p> There isn't any short answer to this questions.  Some students
  have reported problems with the graphic interface in the past but
  there wasn't anyway to systematically repeat these problems.  You may
  get an error message like the following one when you submit your
  assignment. </p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="broken_graphic_tool.png"
       alt="Error message after submitting an assignmenton Mobius"
       style="height: 170px;" class="MobiusFig">
</div>

<p> If you do, you should then verify the syntax for your answer.</p>

<div class="LOOK" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%">
It is recommended to use the scientific calculator notation (see
question below) when you can to avoid problems with the equation editor.
</div>

<h3 id="Q3">How do I write this mathematical expression?</h3>

<p> There isn't any short answer to this question.  We provide below
  some information to get started answering questions. </p>

<p> Since the equation editor may not always be reliable, we strongly
  suggest to use the text mode (when available) and write your answer
  in scientific notation. Here are some examples. </p>

<div>
<table>
  <tr style="background-color: inherit;">
    <th> Expression </th>
    <th> Scientific notation </th>
    <td rowspan="5" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-top: 0px;"> &nbsp; </td>

    <th> Scientific notation </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \(5 x\) </td>
    <td> <em class="Equations"> 5 * x </em> </td>
    <td> \( 3^2\) </td>
    <td> <em class="Equations"> 3&wedge;2 </em> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \( (x^2+3 x)^5 \) </td>
    <td> <em class="Equations"> (x&wedge;2+3 *x)&wedge;5 </em>  </td>
    <td> \( 6^{1/3} \) </td>
    <td> <em class="Equations"> 6&wedge;(1/3) </em> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \( \sqrt{5} \) </td>
    <td> <em class="Equations"> 5&wedge;(1/2)</em> or
      <em class="Equations">sqrt(5)</em> </td>

    <td> </td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Parentheses are very important when writing rational exponents. For
  instance, \( x\wedge 1/2 = (x\wedge 1)/2 = x/2 \) instead of \(
  x\wedge (1/2) \) as it is probably intended. You must write \(
  x\wedge(1/2)\) to get \(x^{1/2}\). You must always put your
  complicated exponents between parentheses.</p> 

<div class="LOOK" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%">
  We therefore strongly suggest that you use the scientific notation
  to enter your answers.

<h3 id="Q6">How do I write a matrix?</h3>

<p>Some questions will require a matrix as answer.  For all these
  questions, you will have to use the equation editor.  The answer to
  the following question is a matrix of dimensions 4 by 2 (4 rows and 2
  columns).  The equation editor is displayed under the question. </p>

<div class="center">

       alt="Image of a question that requires a matrix as solution.  The question editor appear below the question."
       style="height: 200px;" class="MobiusFig">
</div>

<p>To write the solution, select the grid (see 1) at the top of
  the equation editor to get the following menu. </p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="matrix_2.png"
       alt="Image of the menu to define the dimension of a matrix"
       style="height: 200px;" class="MobiusFig">
</div>

<p>There are some pre-defined matrices: a \(2 \times 1\),
  a \(1 \times 2\), a \(2 \times 2\) and a \(3 \times 3\) matrix (see
  2).  If the matrix that you need corresponds to one of these
  matrices, it suffices to click on the icon associated to the
  matrix that you want.  For our example, the matrix that we need isn't
  among the pre-defined matrices.   We use the bottom part of the menu
  (see 3) to enter the dimensions of our matrix (see 4) </p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="matrix_3.png"
       alt="Image of the menu to define the dimension of a matrix"
       style="height: 200px;" class="MobiusFig">

<p> and press <em>enter</em> to get the \(4 \times 2\) matrix that we
  need (see 5). </p>

<div class="center">

       alt="Image of equation editor including the new 4 by 2 matrix"

<p> It suffices to replace the number 1, 2, ... by the values
  required for your answer. </p>

<h3 id="Q14">What do you mean by <q lag="EN">accurate to five decimal
    places</q> or <q lang="EN">with five significant digits?</q></h3>

<p>If you are asked to give an answer accurate to <em>n</em> decimal
  places, you must round up the answer to the <em>n<sup>th</sup></em>
  digits that follow the decimal point.  For instance, the number &pi;
  to four decimal places is 3.1416.  The fraction 1∕4 to three
  decimal places is 0.250&nbsp;. The number 0.03456, to three decimal
  places is 0.035&nbsp;. <em>Don’t forget to perform rounding.</em></p>

<p>If you are asked to give an answer to <em>n</em> significant digits (or
  figures), you must round up the answer to <em>n</em> digits counting
  from the first non zero digit. For instance, the number &pi; to four
  significant figures is 3.142.  The fraction 1∕4 to four
  significant figures is 0.2500&nbsp;; you must add the two zeros at
  the end to indicate that they are parts of your four significant
  digits.  The number 0.03456, to three significant figures is
  0.0346&nbsp;. <em>Don’t forget to perform rounding.</em></p>

<p>For large numbers, you should use the scientific notation
  \(a \text{E} b = a \times 10^b\) with \(|a| \leq 1\) to write a 
  number with <em>n</em> significant digits.  For instance, the number
  1,345,900.23 to four significant digits is \( 0.1346\text{E}7\).
  999,600 to three significant digits is \( 1.00\text{E}6 \)
  or \( 0.100\text{E}7 \).  Again, the two zeros at the end are
  required.  If you write 1,000,000 , Möbius may say that your
  answer is <em>partially correct</em>.  It does that because it
  cannot determine how many of the zeros are significant digits in
  your answer. </p>

<h3 id="Q9">What do I do when Möbius says that I'm wrong but I know I'm
  right?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>First, check your syntax.   For instance, if the answer is
    \( x^2 \cos(x) \) and you write \( t^2 \cos(t)\), then Möbius
    will mark your answer wrong because you have used an
    independent variable (i.e. t) other than the independent variable
    requested (i.e. x). </li>
  <li>If the requested answer is a <em>Numerical value</em>, make sure
    that you have entered it to the required precision (either the
    exact value, the right number of significant digits, the right
    number of decimal places, or the right percentage of error).
    Almost all numerical answers will require 2 or 3-decimal accuracy.
    Moreover, questions asking for a numerical answer will often not
    accept formulae.   Therefore, you must provide a number.  For
    instance, if the exact answer is <em class="Equations">ln(2)</em>
    and the requested answer must be given with an accuracy of
    <em>2 decimal places</em>, then you must write
    <em class="Equations">0.69</em> instead of
    <em class="Equations">ln(2)</em> which is 0.69314718...
    <div class="LOOK" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%"> Though you
      may be asked to give your answer to a required precision (e.g. 2
      or 3 decimal places), you must perform your computations with as
      many digits as your pocket calculator can handle.  Only when
      comes the time to enter your answer should you round your answer
      to satisfy the requirements of the question. </div>
  </li>
  <li>The margin of error must not be included in the
    <em>numerical answers</em>.  For instance, if the answer provided
    by Möbius is <em class="Equations">0.333 &plusmn; 0.001</em>, your
    answer must be a number between <em class="Equations">0.332</em>
    and <em class="Equations">0.334</em>.  You must not write
    <em class="Equations">0.333 &plusmn; 0.001</em>.
    Möbius does not understand the symbol &plusmn; in a
    <em>numerical answer</em>. </li>
  <li> If your browser is configured to use the English language (all
    the instructions of Möbius are in English), then the period marks
    the beginning of the decimal numbers.  If instead your browser is
    configured to use the French language (all the instructions of
    Möbius are in French), then the period still marks the beginning of
    the decimal numbers -- Not the comma as you will normally expect
    in French. </li>
  <li> For <em>algebraic answers</em>, there's a
    preview link or button you can press to see the formula you have
    typed in.  If the formula doesn't look right, add appropriate
    parentheses. </li>
  <li> Remember that when the answer is supposed to be exact, or a
    formula, then you cannot enter <em class="Equations">1.414</em>
    if the correct answer is <em class="Equations">sqrt(2)</em>.  A
    decimal approximation is just that: an approximation. </li>
  <li> If the required answer is a list, be sure to check if Möbius
    wants commas (,) or semicolons (;) to delimit the entries.  This
    information is written immediately under the answer box. </li>
  <li> Some questions are of the form <q lang="en">give all values of
      x such that ...</q> or <q lang="en">give a list of ... </q>.
    Möbius will mark the entire answer as wrong even if there is
    only one wrong value in your list or if your list is missing a
    single value.  Möbius won't tell you what is the problem with
    your list. </li>
</ul>

<p> If Möbius wrote "<em>Correct answer not defined</em>", what
  Möbius tells you is that no answer has been given for the display.
  Möbius has the right answer and can determine if your answer is
  right or wrong.  You can find the right answer used by Möbius in
  the detailed solution of the question when you are given access to
  it.  Look at the answer to the questions <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK("#Q11", "How can I check my grade? How do I get the solutions?",
    "MMathSStat","Q11b","_top"); </script> to get the
  instructions to access the detailed solutions of an assignment. </p>

<div class="LOOK" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%">
  <q lang="EN"><em>No, I'm definitely right and Möbius is wrong</em>
    because I used Wolfram|Alpha (or a similar software) to get the
    answer and I cut and pasted it to Möbius.</q>  We will skip the
    fact that this is called <em>academic fraud</em>.  When you cut an
    answer from a web browser or any graphical application, you cut
    characters that are not produced by your keyboard.  Möbius rejects
    those characters and therefore your answer.
</div>

<p> If you are really sure that none of the above apply to your
  problem, you may email your instructor.  <em> You must consult</em>
  the answer to the question <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK("#Q13", "Who do I talk to if after all that I'm still having problems with Möbius?",
    "MMathSStat","Q13c","__top"); </script> for the instructions to
  contact your instructor.</p>

<p> <em>But it could be a bug!</em> Yes, that's possible, of course.
  We test questions but are only human.  Möbius generates statistics
  on each question of an assignment on a continuous basis during
  the period of accessibility.  We look at them on a regular basis.
  If a question has a bug, that question would start showing a
  horribly low success rate, which would signal us that something is
  wrong.  If a question were broken, you would get a message (on the
  assignment itself or on the course website) telling you to ignore
  that question and just do the rest of the assignment.</p>

<p> So don't give up!  But don't spend hours on a single question.
  You may get some help at the <script language="javascript">

<h3 id="Q13">Who do I talk to if after all that I'm still having problems with
  Möbius?</h3>

<p> Please contact your instructor by email if you cannot find any
  solution to your problem in the help section of Möbius or in this
  FAQ section.  In your email to your instructor, you must
  include <em>ALL</em> the following information:
  your <em>@uottawa.ca</em> email address, your <em>student Id
  number</em>, the <em>assignment title</em> and <em>the question
  number</em>.  You may also include a brief description of your
  problem.</p>
