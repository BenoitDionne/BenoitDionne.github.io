<h2> How to Use Möbius with BrightSpace </h2>

<h3> Getting started </h3>

<div class="LOOK" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">
You must use <em>Chrome</em> as browser (Firefox is no longer
supported by M&ouml;bius).  You must also make sure
that third party cookies are accepted by your browser.   For more
information on allowing third party cookies on your browser, please
consult the site
<script language="javascript">
  buildLinK("https://digitaled.com/support/help/Content/STUD-GENERAL.FUNCTIONS/Access%20using%20an%20LMS.htm?Highlight=cookies",
  "Access using a LMS","MMathSStat","cookies", "_blank");
</script>.<br>
<em>Note</em>: Apple computers are notoriously problematic because
they do not respect standards.  The browser Safari is to be
avoided.</div>

<ul>
<li> You must first create your course on Möbius and a LTI link in
  BrightSpace to the homepage on Möbius for your course.  To do that,
  follow the instructions on the page
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_link_class.url_en, Mbs_link_class.text_en,"MMathSStat",
    Mbs_link_class.id, Mbs_link_class.target);
  </script>.  You must always access Möbius with this link to the
  homepage on Möbius.  This is where you will go to create your
  assignments/exams.  If you do not have a user account on Möbius, at
  the same time that you create this link, your instructor account on
  Möbius will be created using your user account on BrightSpace.</li>
<li> Second, you must create a module on BrightSpace for the LTI links
  to your Möbius assignments.  We assume that you know how to create
  modules on BrightSpace.  If you do not, consult the section
  <em>Adding Modules to Your Course</em> on the site
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_brightspace.url_en, Mbs_brightspace.text_en,"MMathSStat",
    Mbs_brightspace.id, Mbs_brightspace.target);
  </script>.  We provide some information on what should go in that
  module on the site
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_BS_module.url_en, Mbs_BS_module.text_en,"MMathSStat",
    Mbs_BS_module.id, Mbs_BS_module.target);
  </script>.</li> 
<li> Third and last, you must add a link to the Gradebook on Möbius in
  your module for the Möbius assignments.  The instructions on how to
  do that can be found on the site
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_link_gradebook.url_en, Mbs_link_gradebook.text_en,
    "MMathSStat", Mbs_link_gradebook.id, Mbs_link_gradebook.target);
  </script>.  Students will use this link to access the detailed
  solutions of their assignments after the deadlines.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Adding Assignments </h3>

<ul>
<li> I assume that you don't want to write your own questions but that
  you want to use the bank of questions that has already been created.
  The page
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_quest_prev.url_en, Mbs_quest_prev.text_en,"MMathSStat",
    Mbs_quest_prev.id, Mbs_quest_prev.target);
  </script> explains how to preview these questions.  You can select
  some of them for your assignment.  Note that you <em>MUST NOT</em> make
  all the questions public.  Those questions are not for practice but
  for testing.  Use the questions in your class textbook for practice. </li>
<li> We provide the instructions to create assignments on Möbius on
  the pages <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_assign.url_en, Mbs_assign.text_en,"MMathSStat",
    Mbs_assign.id, Mbs_assign.target);
  </script>
  and <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_policy.url_en, Mbs_policy.text_en,"MMathSStat",
    Mbs_policy.id, Mbs_policy.target);
  </script>.</li>
<li> You will find on the page
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_link_assign.url_en, Mbs_link_assign.text_en,"MMathSStat",
    Mbs_link_assign.id, Mbs_link_assign.target);
  </script> the instructions to create a link in BrightSpace to your
  assignment in Möbius.</li>
</ul>

<p> You can find more information to properly use Möbius on the page
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_using.url_en, Mbs_using.text_en,"MMathSStat",
    Mbs_using.id, Mbs_using.target);
  </script>.</p>
