<h2> Rules for the Assignments </h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

<div class="LOOK" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">
If you are creating an assignment to be shared with the children of a
class, you must remember that the properties of an assignment shared
with children of a class are those present at the time that the
assignment is <em>saved for the first time</em>.  You may still add
questions after having saved an assignment and they will be shared
with the children of the class. </div>

<p> Here are some instructions for the section <em>Properties</em> when
  creating an assignment.</p>

<p>To understand how to set the properties of an assignment, it may be
  good to look at an existing assignment.  There may be some in the
  parent directories of your course that you may look at.</p>

<p>The section (or tab) <em>Properties</em> is composed of 7 main
  sections that we will investigate in detail below:
  <em>Type of Assignment</em>, <em>Policy Set</em>, <em>General
    Properties</em>, <em>Scheduling and Visibility</em>, <em>Feedback
    (After)</em>, <em>Reporting</em> and <em>IP Address/ Host Names
    Whitelist</em>.</p> 

<h3> Type of Assignment </h3>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_1.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the first section of the tab Properties to
	    create an assignment">
</div>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li> <p>The simple type is <em>Anonymous Practice</em>.  No grade is
    recorded.</p> </li>
<li> <p>The second and probably the most often used type is
    <em>Homework and Quiz</em>.</p>
<p>The items that you may want to check under <em>Homework and
    Quiz</em> are <em>Additional Attempts</em> (checked by
  default), <em>Keep Correct Answers</em> and <em>Printable
    Version</em>.  When students ask for a new version of the assignment
  and <em>Keep Correct Answers</em> has been selected, they get the
  exact same question only for the questions that they did
  perfectly.  <em>Printable Version</em> lets students print a copy of
  the online assignment.  They may work on the assignment on paper and
  enter their solutions later.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>The third type is <em>Proctored Exam</em>.  You may consider
    using this type of assignments to give an exam.  In a computer lab
    environment, this is probably a great tool.  There are however
    many issues when using this type of assignment for an exam at
    home.</p>
<ul>
<li> The use of the <em>Password Authorization</em> in an exam at home
  is the first issue.  How will you distribute the password to all the
  students?  If there are 200 students, you basically have to give
  away the password to all the students without doing any identity
  check because all the students have to start at about the same time.
  It is therefore not better than to open the exam to every body.</li>
<li> If you select <em>Require Proctored Browser</em>, the exam starts
  in the full screen environment.  If a student access any other
  application, he or she loses access to the exam.  The student then
  has to contact you to obtain access again to the exam.   This is
  great in a computer lab environment where you can control which
  applications are installed on the computers and which are running in
  the background.  This is totally different if students are writing
  their exam on their home computer.  You don't know which application
  is installed and running on their computer.  If ever a popup window
  open in the full screen environment, the student loses access to the
  exam.  Considering that must students are running chat and social
  media software in the background, you must count on many students
  being kick out of their exam by such application generating a popup
  window.</li>
<li>To control access to the exam in the <em>Proctored Exam</em>
  environment, you have to use the item <em>Proctor Tools</em> in the
  menu at the top of the M&ouml;bius screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <p>The type of assignments <em>Mastery Dialog</em> has not been
    used by the author yet.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>Similarly, the type of assignments <em>Study Session
      Dialog</em> has also not been used by the author yet.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3> Policy Set </h3>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_2.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the second section of the tab Properties to
	    create an assignment">
</div>
<p>Using the pull down menu on the left margin, it is possible to
  select a predefined <em>policy set</em>.  You may define
  a <em>policy set</em> to be used for all your assignments by
  selecting the item <em>Policy Sets</em> under <em>Current Class</em>
  as shown in the figure below.  You get a form with all the elements
  displayed above.  In addition, there is a section entitle <em>Only
    Applicable to Lessons</em> that you should ignore.  As the title
  says, it does not apply to assignments.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_27.png" style="width: 450px"
       alt="Screenshot of the menu after selecting Content Repository">
</div>

<h4> General Properties </h4>

<ul>
<li> You may set a <em>Time Limit</em> for the assignment.  Once
  started, a student has this amount of time to complete the
  assignment.  The timer doesn't stop if the students log out.</li>
<li> <em>Show Launch Page</em> must be <em>On</em>.  You want and hope
  that students will read the conditions for the assignments including
  the starting and the due dates and times.</li>
<li>Check <em>Limit Visibility by Dates</em> if you want students to
  see the assignment on their list of assignments for only a limited
  period of time.  Otherwise, students will always see the assignment on
  their list of assignments.  They will not be able to access the
  assignment before the <em>Start Date</em> or after the <em>End
  date</em>.  We suggest not to check this item.  That way students
  can see when the next assignment is coming.</li> 
<li> Leave <em>Limit Visibility by Advanced Policy</em>
  turned <em>Off</em> unless you have defined advanced policies.
  More on this subject later. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Feedback (During) </h4>

<ul>
<li> <em>Show Hints</em> should be <em>On</em>.  For the bank of
  problems that we have produced, the hints are not hints about how to
  solve a problem but hints about how to write expression in MÃ¶bius
  like <q lang="en">a<sup>b is written a^b.</q></li>
<li> <em>Show One Hint At A Time</em> should be turned <em>Off</em>.</li>
<li> <em>Show Current Grade</em> should also be turned <em>Off</em>
  because students can use it to figure out if they got the right
  answer. </li>
<li> <em>Allow Resubmit</em> should be turned <em>On</em>.  This gives
  the chance to students to modify the answers that they have given to
  previous questions before submitting their assignment.</li>
<li><em>How Did I Do?</em> may be turned <em>On</em> if you want to
  let students check their answer before submitting the assignment.</li>
<li>You may impose a cap on the number of times that students may
  use <em>How Did I Do?</em> to check their answer to a question by
  entering the maximum number in the field associated to
  <em>Maximum <q lang="en">How did I do?</q> Uses</em>. </li>
<li> If you select the option <em>How Did I Do?</em>, you should
  choose <em>Never</em> for the items <em>Show Correct Answer</em>
  and <em>Show Question Feedback</em>.  You don't want students
  to see the answers and the detailed solutions.  You only
  want students to be told if their answer is right or wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Feedback (After) </h4>

<ul>
<li> <em>Show Final Grade</em> should be <em>On</em> unless you don't
  want students to see their final grade.</li>
<li> If you want students to get the answers and solutions after
  the <em>End Date</em> that you will specify later, select
  <em>If Incorrect</em> or <em>Always</em> for the item <em>Show Correct
    Answer</em> and select <em>Always</em> for the item <em>Show
    Question Feedback</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Advanced Policies </h4>

<p>It is possible to restrict the access to an assignment to students
  who have satisfied some milestones based on previous assignments.
  If you click on the button <em>Advanced Policies</em> in the left
  margin, then you get the following display.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_28.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the display after clicking on Advanced Policies">
</div>

<p>If you click on <em>Design</em>, then you get the following form.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_29.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the form to enter the criteria">
</div>

<p>To create the first condition for the first criterion, you have
  three pull down menus.  The first one has the items <em>has</em>
  and <em>has not</em>.  The second pull down menu has the
  items <em>passed</em>, <em>made one or more attempts
    at</em>, <em>made two or more attempts at</em>, <em>made three or
    more attempts at</em>, <em>made four or more attempts
    at</em>, <em>made five or more attempts at</em>, <em>made an
    attempt today at</em> and <em>received special permission
    for</em>.   The last pull down menu has the list of available
  assignments.  If you want to add another condition to the first
  Criterion, you only have to click on <em>Add alternative
    criterion</em>.   This option is equivalent to a <em>or</em>.  The
  first criterion is satisfies if any of the condition is
  satisfied.</p>

<p>Similarly, you may define a second criterion by clicking on <em>Add additional criterion</em>.   This is equivalent to an <em>and</em>.   All the criterion must be satisfied for the assignment to be given to the student.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_30.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the form with more than one criteria">
</div>

<h3> General Properties </h3>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_3.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the third section of the tab Properties to
       create an assignment">
</div>

<ul>
<li> Under <em>Maximum Attempts</em>, you choose the maximum number of
  attempts that students may have for the assignment or
  select <em>Unlimited</em> if students can try it as many times as they
  want. </li>
<li> You may set a <em>Passing Grade</em> for the assignment.  This is
  useful in section <em>Feedback (After)</em> below and for the
  <em>Advanced Policy</em> section above.</li>
<li> You should check <em>Check Question(s) Per Page</em> and type in
  the number of questions that students should see per page.  We
  recommend one question par page.  If you do not select this item,
  students will get all the questions of the assignment on one page.
  You may ignore the item <em>One Question Group Per Page</em>.  This
  is useful only if you have groups of questions of the form
  <q lang="en">2 among 5</q> and you want the two questions to appear
  on the same page.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Scheduling and Visibility </h3>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_4.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the fourth section of the tab Properties to
       create an assignment">
</div>

<ul>
<li> You must check <em>Visible (Master)</em>.  If you do not, your
  assignment will never appear on the students' list of assignments;
  not even between the <em>Start Date</em> and <em>End Date</em> defined
  below.</li>
<li>Check <em>Start Date</em> and set the date and time when the
  assignment will start.</li>
<li>Check <em>End Date</em> and set the due date of the assignment.</li>
<li>Check <em>Restrict Feedback Until</em> and set the date and time.
  If you do not do this, students will have access to the answers and
  detailed solutions right after they submit their assignment.  You
  may want to limit the access to the detailed solutions until
  the <em>End Date</em> of the assignment at least.  We suggest to
  enter a date and time after the <em>End Date</em> to give you the
  opportunity to change the <em>End Date</em> if you decide to give
  more time to the students to complete their assignment.</li> 
<li>Check <em>Schedule Force Grading On</em> and set the date and
  time.   By default, assignments that have not been submitted by
  the <em>End Date</em> are not submitted automatically.  This gives
  the instructor the possibility to change the deadline to submit the
  assignment and give more time to students to do it.  Students who
  had not submitted their assignment can then keep on working on them.
  We suggest to check this item and set the date and time to the same
  date and time that were used for item <em>Restrict Feedback
  Until</em> above.  This still give you the opportunity to give more
  time to do the assignment if you wish to do so.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Feedback (After) </h3>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_5.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the fifth section of the tab Properties to
       create an assignment">
</div>

<ul>
<li> You may ignore the item <em>Set Grading Message</em>.  There is a
  default message if the final grade is displayed.  The message is
  fine.  You may want to set a message if you do not display the final
  grade.</li>
<li> If you have set a <em>passing grade</em> in the
  section <em>General Properties</em> above, you may want to
  use <em>Set Pass/Fail Message</em> to leave a message to the
  students according to their result for the assignment.</li>
<li> If you want students to get your Pass/Fail message, you must
  set <em>Show Pass/Fail Message</em> to at least <em>If Finale Grade
    is Shown</em> when the final grade is displayed.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Reporting </h3>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_6.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the sixth section of the tab Properties to
       create an assignment">
</div>

<p>You may want that an email be sent to you after each student
submits his/her assignment.  With a class of 200 students, that may
means 200 emails in your Inbox.</p>

<h3> IP Address/ Host Names Whitelist </h3>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_7.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the seventh section of the tab Properties to
       create an assignment">
</div>

<p>You may limit access to the assignment to a limited set of
  computers.  This could be very useful for a test in a lab where you
  only want students using computers in the lab to access the test.</p>
