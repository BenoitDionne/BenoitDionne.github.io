<h2> Some Features of BrightSpace </h2>

<div class="LOOK" style="width=40%; float: left;">

<p> This site covers only the features of BrightSpace that you have to
  understand to properly build links from BrightSpace to Möbius.  This
  is not at all an exhaustive introduction to BrightSpace.</p>
  
<h3 id="adding_mod" style="clear:both;"> Adding Modules to Your Course </h3>

<p>Normally, you start with an empty page.  The screenshot below
  contains many modules and sub-modules (Chapter 1, Section 1.1,
  Fichier PDF, etc) that were previously added by the author.</p>   

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_25.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the course home page">
</div>

<p> Suppose that you want to add a module entitled <em>chapitre 2</em>.
  it suffices to type in the title of the module in the little field
  under the <em>Table of Contents</em> in the left menu, and press
  return.  You get the following left menu </p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_29.png" style="width: 200px"
       alt="Screenshot of the left menu with the title chapitre 2
	    added to the Table of Contents">
</div>

<p>and the following content on the right side of it.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_30.png" style="width: 400px"
       alt="Screenshot of the area to the right of the left menu">
</div>

<p>You now have to define the properties of your new module.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li> <p>Click on <em>Add dates and restrictions ...</em> (item <em>1</em>
    in the figure above) to set the period of accessibility of the
    module.  You may also give conditions that students must satisfy to
    access the module.  By default, there is no restriction at all on
    accessing the module.  This is probably fine for most modules.</li>
<li> <p>If you click on the item <em>Add a description ...</em>
    (item <em>2</em> in the figure above), you get the following display
    where you can enter the description of the module.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Fig_31.png" style="width: 400px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the display to enter the description of
	      the module">
  </div>
<li> <p> You can select under <em>Upload / Create</em>
    (item <em>3</em> in the figure at the top of the list) the type of
    document that you want to add to your module.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Fig_32.png" style="width: 200px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the list of items under Upload / Create">
  </div>
  <p>You may <em>Upload Files</em>, <em>Create a Link</em>, etc.  This
    menu is really important in general but not for us right now in the
    context of linking BrightSpace to Möbius.  We will not say more
    about it.</p>
</li>
<li> There are several activities under <em>Add Activities</em>, also
  called <em>Existing Activities</em> (item <em>4</em> in the figure
  at the top of the list) that you can include to a module.  The most
  important one for us is <em>External Learning Tools</em>.  We show in
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_link_class.url_en, Mbs_link_class.text_en,"MMathSStat",
    Mbs_link_class.id, Mbs_link_class.target);
  </script>, <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_link_assign.url_en, Mbs_link_assign.text_en,"MMathSStat",
    Mbs_link_assign.id, Mbs_link_assign.target);
  </script> and <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_link_gradebook.url_en, Mbs_link_gradebook.text_en,
    "MMathSStat", Mbs_link_gradebook.id, Mbs_link_gradebook.target);
  </script> how we use it.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>You can select <em>Bulk Edit</em> (item <em>5</em> in the
    figure at the top of the list) if you want to edit all the
    properties of a module at the same time.  We will not cover
    this item in this document since we have never used it.</p>
</li> 
<li><p> This area <em>Drop and drag ...</em> (item <em>6</em> in the
    figure at the top of the list) is for those who do not like menu.
    You can simply drag and drop a document into this area to add it
    to the module.  After that, you can proceed with editing the
    property of your document as we are now doing for the module that
    we are now adding.</p>
</li>
<li><p> You can use <em>Add sub-module,...</em> (item <em>7</em> in
    the figure at the top of the list) to add modules inside a
    module.  It suffices to write the title of this sub-module in
    this field.   For instance, if you type in <em>chapitre 2.1</em>,
    we get the following left menu</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Fig_37.png" style="width: 200px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the left menu with the title section 2.1
	      added to the Table of Contents">
  </div>
  <p>and the following content in the right area.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Fig_38.png" style="width: 400px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the right area for the content page">
  </div>
  <p>If you click on the title <em>section 2.1</em> in the
    <em>Table of Contents</em>, you get the full menu to edit this new
    sub-module.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Fig_42.png" style="width: 400px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the full menu to edit the module section 2.1 ">
  </div>
  <p> You edit this sub-module as we are doing right now with the
    module <em>chapitre 2</em>.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>If you click on <em>Published</em> (or <em>Unpublished</em>)
    (item <em>8</em> in the figure at the top of the list), you get a
    menu that let you unpublish (or publish) a module, a sub-module or
    any document.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Fig_43.png" style="width: 250px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the menu to publish or unpublish a module">
  </div>
  <p>In the latest version of BrightSpace, this item is represented by
    an eye for visible and an eye that has been stroked through for
    invisible.  When you create a module, the default
    is <em>Published</em>.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>Finally, there is a drop-down menu under the title of the module
    (item <em>9</em> in the figure at the top of the list).</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Fig_46.png" style="width: 300px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the menu to publish or unpublish a module">
  </div>
  <p> There are some useful items under this drop-down menu:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disk;">
    <li> You can edit the title of the module with <em>Edit Title</em>
      (item <em>a</em> in the figure above). </li>
    <li> Select <em>Download</em> (item <em>b</em> in the figure
      above) to download the documents that you may have uploaded to
      the module.  You get a zip file of these documents.  WARNING:
      this does not do the backup of the module. </li>
    <li> Use the <em>Set Default Path</em> (item <em>b</em> in the
      figure above) to choose the directory on the BrightSpace server
      where the documents that you upload to the module will be
      stored. </li>
    <li> You can always use <em>Delete Module</em> (item <em>d</em> in
      the figure above) to do exactly that, delete the module. </li> 
  </ul>
  <p>The items <em>Move Up</em> and <em>Move Down</em> may be useful
    but it is more efficient to drag and drop modules to move them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There is a sophisticated graphic tool to add content to your
  course.  The item <em>Course Builder</em> under <em>Course Admin</em>
  gives you access to a graphical interface to add modules, documents,
  ... to your course.  It is easy to use this tool if you learned what
  we presented above.</p>

<h3 id="manage_grades"> Managing Grades </h3>

<h4> Introduction </h4>

<p>After selecting the tab <em>Grades</em> in the top menu of the
  website for your course in BrightSpace, select the tab
  <em>Manage Grades</em> to get the following display.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_81.png" style="width: 400px"
       alt="Screenshot of the tab Manage Grades of the grade section">
</div>

<p>There are two items present on that tab by default:
  <em>Final Calculated Grade</em> and <em>Final Adjusted Grade</em>
  which are not displayed in the figure above.  We address these items
  in the section <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK("#enter_grades", "Enter Grades","MMathSStat", "engr", "_top");
  </script> below.  For now, we consider the two items, <em>Item</em>
  and <em>Category</em>, under the cascading menu <em>New</em>
  (item <em>1</em> in the figure above).</p>

<p>You select <em>Item</em> (item <em>2</em> in the figure above) to
  create a component to evaluate the students' knowledge; for
  instance, the final exam, a partial exam, an assignment, etc.   You
  select <em>Category</em> (item <em>3</em> in the figure above) to
  create a components of your evaluation that is composed of many
  items; for instance, the category <q lang="en">Assignments</q> may
  contains the items: <q lang="en">Assignment 1</q>,
  <q lang="en">Assignment 2</q>, ... </p>

<h4> Create a Category </h4>

<p>If you select <em>Category</em>, you get the following display.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_82.png" style="width: 500px"
       alt="Screenshot of the tab Properties of the display to define
	    a new category">
</div>

<p>Initially, you are under the <em>Properties</em> tab
  (item <em>4</em> in the figure above).  You enter
  the title of the category in the <em>General</em> section
  (item <em>4.5</em> in the figure above).  Let's
  say that this category will be called <em>Midterm</em>.  There
  are two important items in the section <em>Grading</em>
  (item <em>5</em> in the figure above).  In the
  present example, we assume that you have selected <em>Weighted</em>
  for your <em>Grading System</em> when you created your course on
  BrightSpace.   You enter the percentage of the final grade
  associated to this category in the field <em>Weight</em>
  (item <em>5</em> in the figure above).</p>

<p>You select under <em>Distribution</em> (item <em>6</em> in the
  figure above) how the items included in the category contribute to
  the grade for this category.  You can select to (1) manually assign
  the contribution of each item to the grade for this category, (2)
  have all items assigned the same weight, or (3) to have the weight
  of the items determined by the maximal grade associated to the item
  (e.g. an assignment out of 20 will count for two assignments out of
  10).</p> 

<p>When you are done, you must <em>Save</em> (item <em>7</em> in the
  figure above) your work before going to the second tab; namely, to
  the <em>Restrictions</em> tab given below.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_83.png" style="width: 400px"
       alt="Screenshot of the tab Restrictions of the display to
	    define a new category">
</div>

<p> The must useful items are found in the <em>General</em> section
  (item <em>10</em> in the figure above) of this tab.  They are
  <em>Category is always visible</em> and <em>Hide this Category</em>.
  By selecting the latest item, you hide the results for this category
  from the students.</p>

<p>When you have finished, you can <em>Save and Close</em>
  (item <em>11</em> in the figure above) if you do
  not have to define another category, or you can <em>Save and New</em>
  (item <em>12</em> in the figure above) if you want to define another
  category.</p>

<h4> Create an Item </h4>

<p> If you select <em>Item</em> (item <em>2</em> of the first figure
  of this section), you get the following display.  An
  item can be an assignment, an exam, ...  To simplify the
  discussion, let's assume that you want to add an assignment.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_84.png" style="width: 500px"
       alt="Screenshot of the first display to define a new item">
</div>

<p> Let's assume that you use numerical values to grade your students.
  If you select <em>Numeric</em> (item <em>13</em> in the figure
  above), you get the following display.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_85.png" style="width: 400px"
       alt="The second display to define a new item has three tabs:
	    Properties, Restrictions and Obectives">
</div>

<p> As for the General section of the form to create a category, 
  the <em>General</em> section (item <em>14</em> in the figure above)
  has fields to enter the title of the assignment that you are
  creating.  Let's say that the title of your assignment
  is <em>Assignment 4</em>.  There is a field that was not present for
  the definition of a category.  It is a field to assign the
  assignment to a category.  Let's say that you have 
  already created a category <em>Assignments</em>.  Then, you will
  select this category under the pull down menu associated to the
  field <em>Category</em> (item <em>15</em> in the figure above).
  There is also a link to create a <em>New Category</em> if you have
  not done it before.  After selecting the
  category <em>Assignments</em> (item <em>20</em> in the figure
  below), you should note that the item <em>Weight</em>
  (item <em>17</em> of the figures above and below) in the
  section <em>Grading</em> is no longer editable.</p>
  
<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_86.png" style="width: 300px"
       alt="Screenshot of the middle section of the second display to
	    define a new item">
</div>

<p>This is expected because if the category <em>Assignments</em> as
  been defined such that the weight of an assignment in this category is
  determined by the maximal grade associated to this assignment.</p>

<p>If the assignment that we are creating is to be included in a
  category where you manually assign the contribution of each
  assignment to the grade for this category, then you enter the
  percentage of the grade for this category attributed to this
  assignment.</p>

<p>If this assignment is not included in any category, then you enter the
  percentage of the final grade attributed to this assignment.</p>

<p>You use the drop down menu under the item <em>Grade Scheme</em>
  (item <em>18</em> in the figure before the previous one) to
  select how grades will be displayed to the students. You have two
  options <em>percentage</em> and <em>uOttawa Alpha</em>.   You will
  more likely choose the first option for assignments from
  Möbius. </p>

<p> The <em>Restrictions</em> tab is almost identical to
  the <em>Restrictions</em> tab under the definition of a category.
  The only difference is that category is replaced by item in the
  menu.  For instance, you select the item <em>Hide this Item</em> to
  hide the results for the assignment from the students.</p>

<p>For those serious educator, there is an <em>Objectives</em> tag
  where you can write the learning outcomes that students should reach
  by completing this assignment.</p>

<p>The display below illustrate the grading scheme for a possible
  course.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_87.png" style="width: 500px"
       alt="Screenshot of the middle section of the second display to
	    define a new item">
</div>

<p>We conclude by pointing out that you can edit items and categories
  later by clicking on their title.</p>

<h4> Reordering Items and Categories </h4>

<p>You may want to reorder the items in the <em>Enter Grades</em>
  section and also how they are displayed to the students.  You can do
  it be selecting the item <em>Reorder</em> (item <em>22</em> in the
  figure below) under the menu <em>More Actions</em> (item <em>21</em>
  in the figure below) of the <em>Manage Grades</em> tab.</p> 

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_105.png" style="width: 300px"
       alt="Screenshot of the top menu of the tab Manage Grade of the
	    Grades section">
</div>

<p>You then get the following table with a list of all items.  There
  is a drop down menu after the name of each item in the
  column <em>Sort Order</em> (item <em>23</em> in the figure above)
  that you can use to select the rank of the item.  When you are done,
  you only have to click on the <em>Save</em> button (item <em>19</em>
  in one of the figure way above).</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_106.png" style="width: 400px"
       alt="Screenshot of the window with the list of all item that
	    can be reordered">
</div>

<h3 id="enter_grades"> Entering Grades </h3>

<h4> Introduction </h4>

<p>First select the tab <em>Grades</em> in the top menu of your course
  website in BrightSpace.  Then, select the tab <em>Enter Grades</em>
  if it is not the one automatically selected.  You get the following
  display.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_88.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the tab Enter Grades of the grade section">
</div>

<p>There are many items to consider in this display.  The purpose of
  the items <em>Import</em> (item <em>1</em> in the figure above) and
  <em>Export</em> (item <em>2</em> in the figure above) is clear.
  you will click on them to import grades from a spreadsheet to the
  grade book of BrightSpace and to export the grades from the grade book 
  on BrightSpace to a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>You can use the field under item <em>4</em> in the figure above to
  request the results of a particular student.  You press the
  magnifying glass beside this field to start the research.  This
  is useful if you are looking for the results of one student in a
  class with hundreds of students.</p>

<p>We will talk about the button <em>Switch to Spreadsheet View</em>
  (item <em>5</em> in the figure above) in a moment when talking
  about entering grades.  You can select some or all students, and
  press the <em>Email</em> icon (item <em>6</em> in the figure above)
  to send them an email.</p>

<p>Note that the little arrow under item <em>7</em> in the figure above
  (a similar arrow may appear on the left if needed) let you scroll the
  grade book when it is wider then the browser display.  Some versions
  of BrightSpace don't have this little arrow.</p>

<p>The cascading menu <em>More Actions</em> (item <em>3</em> in the
  figure above) offer some additional options (but not that many more).</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_89.png" style="width: 200px"
       alt="Screenshot of the cascading menu under More Actions">
</div>

<p>You select <em>Hide/Show Columns</em> to select the categories and
  items (columns of the grade book) that you want to see.</p> 

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_90.png" style="width: 300px"
       alt="Screenshot of the form to select the items to be visible
	    to the students">
</div>

<p>You simply check the box beside the items that you want to see, and
  press <em>Save</em> when you are done.  The results under the
  non-selected category or item are not hidden from the students.  To
  do so, you have to use the <em>Restrictions</em> tab when you define
  a category or an item as explained in the section
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK("#manage_grades", "Manage Grades on BrightSpace","MMathSStat",
    "mangra", "_top");
  </script> above.</p>

<h4> Entering Grades </h4>

<p>There are two options to enter the grades for an item.  If you
  select <em>Grade All</em> from the drop down menu that you get by
  clicking on the little down arrow beside the name of the item,</p> 

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_91.png" style="width: 400px"
       alt="Screenshot of the cascading menu that you get by clicking
	    on the down arrow beside the name of an item">
</div>

<p>you get the following display.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_92.png" style="width: 500px"
       alt="Screenshot of the form to enter the grade for the item
	    that you have selected">
</div>

<p>In this presentation, the student ID numbers have been removed from
  the table.  Consult the section
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK("#manage_grades", "Manage Grades on BrightSpace","MMathSStat",
    "mangra", "_top");
  </script> above to find out how to add the student ID number beside
  each student name.</p>

<p> You enter grades as you normally do in a spreadsheet in the
  section identified as item <em>6</em> in the figure
  above.  <em>Please, do not forget to save the data that you enter on
    a regular basis</em>.  You do not want to loose all your work because
  you inadvertently close your browser.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li> <p>If you have many students who got the same mark, you may select
    all of them by checking the box beside their name and clicking on
    the icon <em>Grade</em> (item <em>1</em> in the figure above) to get
    a popup menu that let you type in the mark they all have.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Fig_93.png" style="width: 200px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the form to enter the grade that all
	      selected students will have">
  </div>
</li>
<li> <p>Similarly, if you need to clear the mark of many students, you
    select all of them by checking the box beside their name and
    clicking on the icon <em>Clear</em> (item <em>2</em> in the figure
    preceding this list) to get a popup window asking you to confirm
    your action.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Fig_94.png" style="width: 200px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the popup window to confirm that you want
	      to clear the mark of the selected students">
  </div>
</li>
<li> <p> If a student is exempted to do an assignment, a partial exam,
    ..., then you can remove this item from the computation of the final
    grade by checking the box beside the name of the student and clicking
    on the <em>Exempt</em> icon (item <em>3</em> in the figure before
    this list).  If the item is part of a category, the
    computation of the grade for this category is done as it should be
    done if the grading distribution is <em>Distribute weights by points
      across all items in the category</em> or <em>Distribute weight
      evenly across all items</em>.  It is not clear how the grade is
    computed in other situations.  More to come on this subject in the
    near future; namely, if someone wants to add something more.</p>
</li>
<li> <p> To cancel the exemption that a student may have for an item,
    check the box beside the name of the student and click on the
    <em>Unexempt</em> icon (item <em>4</em> in the figure before this
    list)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The role of the <em>Email</em> icon (item <em>5</em> in the
    figure before this list) is to send emails to all the students who
    would have been selected.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Please, never forget to <em>Save and Close</em> (item <em>7</em> in
  the figure before the list) when you are done.  In particular,
  before closing your browser or shutting down your computer.</p>

<p>The second option to enter grades is to click on <em>Switch to
    Spreadsheet View</em> (item <em>5</em> in the figure before the
  list) to get a normal spreadsheet.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_95.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the grade book in the mode spreadsheet view">
</div>

<p>There is no options in this mode.  You can go back to the default
  view mode by clicking on <em>Switch to Standard View</em>
  (item <em>8</em> in the figure above).  Please,
  never forget to <em>Save</em> (item <em>7</em> in the figure above)
  your work on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Finally, if you want to enter or edit the grade for several items
  of a student, you can simply click on the name of the student to get
  the following display.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Fig_96.png" style="width: 400px"
       alt="Screenshot of the form that one gets afer clicking on the
	    name of a student">
</div>

<h4> Interpreting the Grades </h4>

<p>You have probably noted that each student gets three values
  separated by commas for each item.  The first value is the mark of
  the student for the item.  The second value is the ratio of the
  number of points that the student gets over the number of points
  that the item represents for the final grade.  Finally, the last
  value is the grade that the student gets out of 100.   This last
  value is determined by the choice that you made for the
  item <em>Grade Scheme</em> when you created the item.    For

  correspond to 50%.  This student also got 1.88 points out of a
  possible 3.75 points for their final course grade.</p>

  the present case, blue is associate to the students who got a grade
