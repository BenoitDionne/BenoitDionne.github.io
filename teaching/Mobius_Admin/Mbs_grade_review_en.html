<h2> Revewing Grades </h2>

<div class="LOOK" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">
You must use <em>force Grade</em> on the assignment before modifying
grades.  If you don't do that, new grades will not be transferred to
BrightSpace. </div>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p>You should not normally have to review the answers of the students.
  You should use the following procedure only to mark the questions
  where students had to upload a document.  You may also want to look
  at the solutions given by the students to find out their common
  mistakes.</p>

<h3> Procedure </h3>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li> <p>To review the grades given by MÃ¶bius to the assignments of
    your students, first select <em>Class Grades</em> under the
    item <em>Gradebook</em> of the top menu (item <em>1</em> of the
    figure below).</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_review_1.png" style="width: 300px"
	 alt="Scrrenshot of the roll down menu under Gradebook">
  </div>
</li>
<li> <p>You get a long form to do a search for the results of your
    students.  The upper part of the form is displayed below.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_review_2.png" style="width: 450px"
	 alt="Scrrenshot of the top part of the form to search for the
	      results to assignments">
  </div>
  <p>The first section is <em>Select Lessons & Assignments</em>.  As
    the title suggests, you select the assignments for which you would
    like to get the results (item <em>2</em> in the figure above).
    The next section is <em>Filter Results</em>.</p>

  <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li> You may enter the ID number of a student in the box beside
      <em>User</em> (item <em>3</em> in the figure above) if you want
      only the results for this specific student.</li>
    <li> You may request under <em>Results</em> (item <em>4</em> in
      the figure above) the results for all attempts, for only the
      best attempt, for all the attempts starting with the best one
      (the one selected in the figure), ...  that the students have
      made for the selected assignments.</li>
    <li> You may restrict further you search by requiring
      under <em>Progress</em> (item <em>5</em> of the figure above) all
      the attempts submitted only, those in progress only, or both of
      them.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li> <p> The bottom part of the form is displayed below.</p>

  <div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_review_3.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Scrrenshot of the bottom part of the form to search for
	    the results to assignments">
  </div>
  <p> The third section is <em>View Panel</em>.  There are many items
    that you may choose to be retrieved and displayed.  We mention
    only those which are the most often used.</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li>The <em>first name</em> and <em>last name</em> of the
      students (item <em>6</em> in the figure above), and their
      <em>student ID</em> (item <em>7</em> in the figure above)</li>
    <li> The <em>start date</em> and <em>end date</em>
      (item <em>8</em> in the figure above), and <em>start time</em>
      and <em>end time</em> (item <em>9</em> in the figure
      above).  This is often use to determine how much time
      students have spent on their assignments or, more likely, when
      they have started to work on their assignments.</li>
    <li> The <em>progress</em> (item <em>10</em> in the figure above).
      It is often used to find out if the assignments are completed
      (submitted) or in progress.  You may request both.</li>
    <li> The <em>Total Points</em> for each student assignments
      (item <em>11</em> in the figure above).  This information is
      always given independently of if you check or not the box.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li> <p>When you have complete the form, you may click
    on <em>Search</em> (item <em>12</em> in the figure above) to get a 
    display that will look like the following one.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_review_4.png" style="width: 600px"
	 alt="Scrrenshot of the search result">
  </div>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li> At the top of the table (item <em>13</em> in the figure above)
      is the list of pages that are displayed, identified by the
      first three letters of the last name of the first student
      listed on that page.  You can click on these three-letter
      items to move from page to page.</li>
    <li> There is a little icon in the column <em>Progress</em>
      (item <em>14</em> in the figure above) if the student has
      started the assignment.  It is yellow if the assignment is in
      progress and green if the assignment has been submitted.</li>
    <li> The grade for the assignment is in the column <em>Grade</em>
      (item <em>15</em> in the figure above).  This grade is a link.
      If you click on this grade, you will get the full details of the
      student's assignment.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li> <p>After clicking on the student grade for an assignment, you get
    a long page with the detailed solutions of the assignment for this
    student.  We display below the top of such a page.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_review_5.png" style="width: 600px"
	 alt="Scrrenshot of the top section of the page with the
	      detailed solutions for the student's assignment">
  </div>
  <p>The top section of the page has the grade that the student has
    obtained for the assignment (item <em>16</em> in the figure above)
    and general information about the student's performance.  Under
    this section is the list of all the questions of the
    assignment.</li> 
<li> <p>We display one of the questions below.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_review_6.png" style="width: 700px"
	 alt="Scrrenshot of one of the questions included in the
	      student's assignment">
  </div>
  <p>The answer given by the student is on the left.  The right answer
    is on the right.  The border of the box with the student's solution
    is green if the answer is right.  It is red if the answer is
    wrong.</p>

  <p>There are several methods to modify the grade of an
    assignment.</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li>YThe first method is to use the box beside
      <em>update selected grades as</em> (item <em>17</em> in the
      figure before the one above) to type in the grade that you want
      to attribute to all the questions that you have previously
      selected (item <em>17.5</em> in the figure above).  You 
      have to press <em>Update Grades</em> (item <em>17</em> in the
      figure before the one above) to implement the modifications.  I
      do not see any reason to modify the grade of many questions at
      the same time.</li>
    <li> The second method is to modify the full grade of a question
    (item <em>18</em> in the figure above), ignoring the results for
    the components of the question.  You can click on the icon for
    comments (item <em>18.5</em> in the figure above) to add the reason
    for changing the grade.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I will focus the explanation to the last method (sitem <em>19</em>
    in the figure above) to modify the grade of an assignment.  This
    is the one that I recommend because it is closely associated to
    the reason to modify the grade.</p>
</li> 
<li> <p>If you click on the icon beside the <em>Grade</em> for a
  component of the question (item <em>19</em> in the figure above), you
  get the following display.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_review_7.png" style="width: 600px"
	 alt="Scrrenshot of menu obtained after clicking on the icon
	      beside the grade">
  </div>
  <p>You enter the new grade for this component of the question in the
    box beside <em>Grade</em> (item <em>20</em> in the figure above) and
    press the icon that looks like a floppy disk (item <em>21</em> in
    the figure above) to save the modification.  If you change your
    mind, you can always cancel the operation by clicking on the X
    icon (item <em>22</em> in the figure above).<p>
</li> 
</ol>

<p>If you go back to the list of assignments using the back arrow of
  your browser, you may realize that the grade of the assignment has
  not changed.  You need to refresh the screen to see the new grade.
  If you are in the process of reviewing many assignments, you should
  not bother with refreshing the screen and just move on to the next
  student.</p>
