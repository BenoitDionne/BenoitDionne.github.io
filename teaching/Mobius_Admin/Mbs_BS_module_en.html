<h2> BrightSpace Module for Möbius Assignments </h2>

<p>We will not explain how to create a module on BrightSpace in this
  page.  We assume that the instructor knows how to create a module on
  Möbius.  We focus on the minimal content of this module.</p>

<p> The introduction of your module for the assignments must include a
  link to the
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mobius.url_en, Mobius.text_en,"MMathSStat", Mobius.id,
    Mobius.target);
  </script>.  On the FAQ website, students will find the instructions
  to buy the licence for M&ouml;bius.  In particular, they will find
  the browser requirements.  The non-compatibility of the browser is
  the most frequent source of problems.  Students must ensure that
  their browser accepts third party cookies.  You must also ensure
  that at least your first assignments open in a new tab, not inside
  BrightSpace.  In fact, it is preferable that they all open in a new
  tab.  It is then easier for students to read long questions.<p>

<p>Obviously, it is in this module that you will include the links
  to your assignments on Möbius.  We explain how to do so on the
  site <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_link_assign.url_en, Mbs_link_assign.text_en,
    "MMathSStat", Mbs_link_assign.id, Mbs_link_assign.target);
  </script>.</p>
    
<p>In addition to the LTI links from BrightSpace to the assignments
  on Möbius, you must also create the LTI link from BrightSpace to
  the Gradebook on Möbius.  Consult the site
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_link_gradebook.url_en, Mbs_link_gradebook.text_en,
    "MMathSStat", Mbs_link_gradebook.id, Mbs_link_gradebook.target);
  </script> for the instruction to do it.   It is through Gradebook
  on Möbius that students will access the detailed solutions of
  their assignments.</p>
