<h2> Proctor Tools </h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p>It may happen that you need to set special accessibility conditions
  to an assignment for some students.  For instance, students with
  SASS may need extra time, or you may need to restart an assignment
  for some students.  To do all that, you need to use the <em>Proctor
    Tools</em> (item <em>1</em> in the figure below). 

<h3> Procedure </h3>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_proctor_1.png" style="width: 500px"
       alt="Scrennshot of the top menu of the home page for a course
       on MÃ¶bius">
</div>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li> <p>After clicking on the item <em>Proctor Tools</em> of the upper
    menu (item <em>1</em> in the figure above), you get the following
    form.</p>
  
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_proctor_2.png" style="width: 500px"
       alt="Screenshot of the form to search for students in the
       proctor tools">
</div> </li>
<li> <p>It is possible to search the list of students registered to
    the course using the <em>Search</em> field but that is not really
    convenient.  You should select <em>Advanced Search</em>
    (item <em>2</em> in the figure above) to get a more detailed form to
    search not only for students but also for specific assignments.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_proctor_3.png" style="width: 750px"
       alt="Screenshot of the form for advanced search in the proctor
       tools">
</div>
<p> The item <em>Roster Search</em> (item <em>2.5</em> in the figures
  above) will be presented in the next section.</p> 
</li>
<li> <p>There are many fields on this form which are
    standard:  <em>Last Name</em>, <em>First Name</em>, <em>User
      Login</em>, <em>Student ID</em> and <em>Email</em>.   If you
    have some of this information, you may enter it to go directly to
    the student that you are looking for.  If you plan to modify the
    accessibility for more than one student, you should ignore those
    fields.  Associated to the previous fields, you can also adjust
    the fields <em>Match</em> amd <em>Case Sensitive</em> to
    specialise even more your search.</p>

<p>The field <em>User Role</em> is set to <em>Student</em>
  and <em>Guess</em>.  There is no reason to change it.</p>

<p>The really interesting and useful fields are <em>Records per
    Page</em> and <em>Assignment Filter</em> (items <em>3</em>
  and <em>4</em> in the figure above).  If you have 200 students in
  your class and you are looking for two names at the opposite ends of
  the alphabet, you should set the <em>Records per Page</em> to 200 or
  more to get them on the same page.</p>

<p>If you are interested in a specific assignment, you should select
  it in the field <em>Assignment Filter</em>.  For the present
  example, we have selected the assignment <em>Devoir 3</em>.  After
  clicking on <em>Search</em> (item <em>5</em> in the figure above),
  you get you class list as represented below.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_proctor_4.png" style="width: 900px"
       alt="Screenshot of the class list with the list of options above it">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>There are many options to select.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li> In <em>6</em> in the figure above, you can select to let some
  students <em>Start/Re-Enter</em> an assignment or <em>Deny
    Access</em> to an assignment to some students.</li>
<li> You can select to grade an assignment for some students by
  checking the box in front of <em>Grade</em> (item <em>7</em> in the
  figure above).</li>
<li> You can even let some students continue to work an assignment
  that the have already submitted by checking the box in front
  of <em>Re-open if already graded</em> (item <em>8</em> in the figure
  above).</li>
<li> Finally, you can change the deadline for some students by
  entering the new date and time in the box beside <em>Extend end date
    until</em> (item <em>9</em> in the figure above).</li>
</ul>
<p> To change the end date, you have to click on the calendar
  (item <em>9</em> in the figure above) to get the following popup
  window.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_proctor_5.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the list of student with the popup window
       displaying a calendar">
</div>
<p> In the figure above, we assume that you want to change the end
  date of <em>Devoir 3</em> for some students to October 10, 2020, at
  3:00 pm.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>You can check the box in front of <em>Select All</em>
    or <em>Set Permission</em> (item <em>10</em> in the second to last
    figure).  Or you can check the box at the beginning of the line
    (item <em>11</em> in the second to last figure) for each students
    to whom the modification should apply as in the figure below.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_proctor_6.png" style="width: 850px"
       alt="Screenshot of the list of students where the box on the
       line of the selected student has a check mark">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>In the figure above, we have assumed that it is the end date
    of <em>Devoir 3</em> for the third student that you want to
    change.  So, you check the box on the third line and click
    on <em>Authorize</em> (item <em>12</em> in the figure above) to
    complete the procedure.  You get the following display.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_proctor_7.png" style="width: 800px"
       alt="Screenshot displaying only the list of students (only one
       in the present case) to whom the modification has been
       applied to">
</div>
<p> As you can see, the end date is now October 10, 2020, at 3:00 pm
  (plus a few seconds).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3> Roster Search </h3>

<p> In the previous section, we ignored the link <em>Roster
    Search</em> (item <em>2.5</em> in the second and third figures of
  the previous section).  It is now time to talk about it.  This
  feature of <em>Proctor Tools</em> is really useful if you are
  looking for many students for whom you know the <em>User
    Login</em>.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li> <p>If you click on the link <em>Roster Search</em>, you get the
    following form.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_proctor_8.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the form to search for students and
       assignments for proctoring">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>You use the <em>Browse</em> button to the right of the
    item <em>Roster File</em> (item <em>1</em> in the figure above) to
    upload a CVS file with the list of students that you are looking
    for.  The CVS file must have one column with title <em>Login</em>.
    On each row, you enter the <em>User Login</em> of one student.</p>

<p>You use the item <em>Assignment Filter/<em> (item <em>2</em> in the
      figure above) to select the assignment whose accessibility
      conditions will be modified.</p>

<p>You should set the <em>Records Per Page</em> (item <em>3</em> in the
  figure above) to a value at least equal to the number of students in
  your CVS file.</p>

<p>Suppose that you have done all these modifications to get the
  following display.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_proctor_9.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the form to search for students and
       assignments for proctoring after having uploaded a file of
       students and selected the assignment">
</div>
<p>The file <em>tmp_tmp.csv</em> has the <em>User Login</em> of two
  students.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you click on <em>Search</em> (item <em>4</em> in the figure
    above), you end up with the following display.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_proctor_10.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the list of students with the list of
       options from the proctoring tools">
</div>
<p> Namely, you end up at <em>step 4</em> in the previous section.
  You can then go on to modify the accessibility conditions of the
  selected assignment for the students in your CSV file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
