<h2> Creating Links to Assignments on Möbius </h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p>On this page, we assume that you already have created some
  assignments in your course on M&ouml;bius or that someone has already
  created the assignments for you.  We also assume that you have
  created a module in BrightSpace for the assignments like the one
  below.</p>

<h3> Procedure to Create a Link to an Assignment on M&ouml;bius </h3>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>To add an assignment from M&ouml;bius, click on the drop down
  menu <em>Add Activity</em> (item <em>1</em> in the figure above) to
  get the following choice of items.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_assign_2.png" style="width: 250px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the list of items under the drop down
	      menu Add Activity">
</div></li>
<li> <p>Select the item <em>Mobius LTI</em> (item <em>2</em>
    in the figure above) to get the following form.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_assign_3.png" style="width: 500px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the pop up window after selectin Mobius LTI">
</div></li>
<li> <p>The course name in the box identified by the item <em>3</em> in the
    figure above should be your course in Möbius.  You should not modify this
    field.   By default, this should be the course that you have
    created and linked to as explained on the site
    <script language="javascript">
      buildLinK(Mbs_link_class.url_en, Mbs_link_class.text_en,"MMathSStat",
      Mbs_link_class.id, Mbs_link_class.target);
    </script>. Select the assignment in the drop down menu identified
    by the item <em>4</em> in the figure above.  In the present case,
    <em>Getting to know Mobius</em>, and click on <em>Link to
      Assignment</em> (item <em>5</em> in the figure above).
    <em>DO NOT</em> click on <em>Link to Class Home</em>.  You should
    then be sent back to your module on BrightSpace for the
    assignment.</p>

    <img src="Mobius_assign_4.png" style="width: 500px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the module on BrightSpace with th enew item">
  </div>
</li>
<li> If you click on <em>Getting to know Mobius</em>. you will get
  the introductory page to the assignment as the students will see it
  when they click on <em>Getting to know Mobius</em>.  This page
  includes all the instructions and policies as defined on
  M&ouml;bius.</p>

</ol>

<h3> BrightSpace Setup for the Link to an Assignment on Möbius </h3>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li> <p>Going back to the module for the assignments on BrightSpace,
    you may want to add a description to your new assignment or at
    least the starting and due dates and times.  To do so, select the
    drop down menu marked by a down arrow beside the title of the
    assignment (item <em>10</em> in the figure above).  You get the
    following list of items.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_assign_6.png" style="width: 300px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the items under the drop down menu">
</div></li>
<li> <p>Select the item <em>Edit Properties In-place</em> (item <em>11</em>
    in the figure above) to get the following form below the title of
    the assignment.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_assign_7.png" style="width: 400px"
	   alt="Screenshot of the form associated to the item Edit
		Properties In-place">
  </div>

  <div class="LOOK" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">
    The box beside <em>Open as External Resource</em> (item
    <em>13</em> in the figure above) should be checked by default.
    If it is not, you must check this box, at least for the first
    assignment.  If you do not do that, students may be timed
    out when trying to buy the license.  So, they will not be able to
    buy the license and they will contact you.  You do not want
    that.<br><br>
    In fact, you should probably always use the option <em>Open as
      External Resource</em> because it also gives a lot larger display
    for the questions of the assignment. </div>

  <div class="LOOK" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">
    Some versions of BrightSpace may also have a drop down menu under
    <em>Edit Properties In-place</em> where you have to indicate if
    the assignment is graded or not.  BrightSpace at the University of
    Ottawa does not seem to have this menu. The assignment is a graded
    one by default. </div>
</li>
<li><p>If you select <em>Add dates and restrictions ...</em>
    (item <em>12</em> in the figure above), you get this extended form.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_assign_8.png" style="width: 400px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the extended form associated to the item
	      Edit Properties In-place">
  </div>
</li>
<li><p>We focus this discussion only on the items <em>Start Date</em>,
    <em>Due date</em>, and <em>End date</em> (items <em>14</em>, <em>15</em>
    and <em>16</em> in the figure above, and items <em>17</em>, <em>18</em>
    and <em>19</em> in the figure).  You enter the starting and due
    dates and times as they are on the M&ouml;bius assignment.  You
    should set the end date and times as the due date and time.  That
    way, students cannot click on the link after the due date and
    time; this is good to do if you want to avoid requests for
    extension from the students.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_assign_9.png" style="width: 300px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the extended form associated to the item
	      Edit Properties In-place with the starting and due dates
	      and times">
</div></li>
<p>After pressing the <em>Update</em> button (item <em>20</em> in the
  figure above), you get the following display on the Module for the
  assignment.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_assign_10.png" style="width: 350px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the section of the Module for the
	      assignments devoted to the new assignment">
</div>
</li> 
</ol>

<h3> Grades on BrightSpace </h3>

<p>If you look in the section <em>Grades</em> on BrightSpace, you may
  not find a column with the assignment that you have just created.
  It is going to be created when students start submitting their
  assignment unless you have turned off <em>Show Final Grades</em> when you
  created the assignment on M&ouml;bius.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assign_11.png" style="width: 300px"
       alt="Screenshot of the section Grades on BrightSpace">
</div>

<p>When the column for your new assignment will have been created, you may
  want to edit it (item <em>21</em> in the figure below) as explained
  in section <em>Managing Grades on BrightSpace</em> on the site
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_brightspace.url_en, Mbs_brightspace.text_en,"MMathSStat",
    Mbs_brightspace.id, Mbs_brightspace.target);
  </script>.</p>

  <img src="Mobius_assign_12.png" style="width: 300px"
       alt="Screenshot of the drop down menu produced by the down
       arrow beside the title of a column in the gradebook on
       BrightSpace">
