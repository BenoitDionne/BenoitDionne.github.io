<h2> How to Use Möbius </h2>

<p>We have divided the instruction material into several topics.  The
topics that the instructor <em>must read carefully</em> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<script language="javascript">
  buildLinK(Mbs_quest_prev.url_en, Mbs_quest_prev.text_en,"MMathSStat",
  Mbs_quest_prev.id, Mbs_quest_prev.target);
</script>:  We explain how to preview questions in the bank of
questions.  This is the first step to create an assignment when the
instructors select the questions that they want for their assignments.
It suffices to write down the numbers of the questions. </li>
<li> <script language="javascript">
  buildLinK(Mbs_assign.url_en, Mbs_assign.text_en,"MMathSStat",
  Mbs_assign.id, Mbs_assign.target);
</script>: We explain how to create an assignment in Möbius using the
list of questions that has been selected previously. </li> 
<li> <script language="javascript">
  buildLinK(Mbs_policy.url_en, Mbs_policy.text_en,"MMathSStat",
  Mbs_policy.id, Mbs_policy.target);
</script>: After having selected the questions for the assignment,
it is time to set the rules (maximal grade, due date, number of
attempts, access to <q lang="en">How did I do?</q>, ...).  This topic
addresses this subject.</li> 
</ul>

<p>The following topics may occasionally be useful.</p>

<ul>
<li> <script language="javascript">
  buildLinK(Mbs_adaptive.url_en, Mbs_adaptive.text_en,"MMathSStat",
  Mbs_adaptive.id, Mbs_adaptive.target);
</script>: This type of assignments is unfortunately not often used.
Students can get harder or easier questions according to their success
in previous questions.  The passing grade for an assignment may be
determined by successfully answering questions at a certain level.
We explain how to create adaptive assignment in this topic.</li>
<li> <script language="javascript">
  buildLinK(Mbs_proctor.url_en, Mbs_proctor.text_en,"MMathSStat",
  Mbs_proctor.id, Mbs_proctor.target);
</script>: We explain how to change the due date of an assignment after
it is active or to modify the rules of an assignment for a student
with special needs. </li>
<li> <script language="javascript">
  buildLinK(Mbs_grade_review.url_en, Mbs_grade_review.text_en,"MMathSStat",
  Mbs_grade_review.id, Mbs_grade_review.target);
</script>: It occasionally happen that we need to modify the grade
of a student assignment.  This topic explains how to do it.</li>
<li> <script language="javascript">
  buildLinK(Mbs_grades.url_en, Mbs_grades.text_en,"MMathSStat",
  Mbs_grades.id, Mbs_grades.target);
</script>: This topic is <em>only</em> for those who use Möbius outside
BrightSpace.  If the Möbius assignments are accessed from a LTI link
in BrightSpace, the grades are automatically transferred to the
gradebook on BrightSpace and nothing needs to be done.</li>
<li> <script language="javascript">
  buildLinK(Mbs_management.url_en, Mbs_management.text_en,"MMathSStat",
  Mbs_management.id, Mbs_management.target);
</script>: For the instructors who will create questions in Möbius
that they plan to use for many courses, we explain how to move questions
from one course to the other.</li> 
<li> <script language="javascript">
  buildLinK(Mbs_owner.url_en, Mbs_owner.text_en,"MMathSStat",
  Mbs_owner.id, Mbs_owner.target);
</script>: Sometime, an instructor would like to know who posted one
of the questions of an assignment on the website to get some help
(i.e. to cheat).  We explain how to find out the identity of the
student.</li>
</ul>
