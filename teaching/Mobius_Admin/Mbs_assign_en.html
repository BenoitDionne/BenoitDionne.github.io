<h2> How to Create Assignments </h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

<div class="LOOK" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">
If you are creating an assignment to be shared with the children of a
class, you must remember that the properties of an assignment shared
with children of a class are those present at the time that the
assignment is <em>saved for the first time</em>.   You may still add
questions after having saved an assignment and they will be shared
with the children of the class. </div> 

<p> We give a summary of the steps to create an assignment. </p>

<h3> Procedure </h3>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li> <p>To create an assignment, you have first to access the
<em>Content Repository</em> (item <em>1</em> in the figure below).</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_8.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the homepage of a course on Möbius">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>Then select the directory <em>Assignments</em> (item <em>2</em>
    in the figure below).</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_9.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the content repository">
</div>
</li>
<li> You get several directories under <em>Assignments<em>.
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_10.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the content repository with some directories">
</div>
<p>Those marked by the green share symbol are directories inherited
  from the parent of your course.  There are assignments that you can
  used.  For instance, for the calculus courses, the parent course
  contains the practice assignment <em>Get to know Möbius</em>.   You
  can create another directory to store your assignments.  In the
  present example, we use the existing directory <em>Default
    Unit</em> (item <em>3</em> in the figure above) to store the
  assignments.  As the name suggests, this directory is created by
  default.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>If you click on <em>Default Unit</em>, you get the following
    directory.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_11.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the content repository with some subdirectories">
</div>
  <p>There are already some assignments in this directory.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>To begin editing your new assignment, select the
    item <em>Assignment</em> (item <em>4</em> in the figure above)
    under the pull down menu <em>Create New</em>.  You get the first
    tab of three tabs to create an assignment.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_12.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the first tab to create an assignment">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>You type in the title of the assignment in <em>Assignment
      Name</em> (item <em>5</em> in the figure above) and a short
    version of the title in <em>Short Name</em> (item <em>6</em> in
    the figure above).  The short version of the title is used when
    listing assignments.  You may enter a description of the
    assignment with your instructions in the
    section <em>Description</em> (item <em>7</em> in the figure
    above).  This description will appear on the front page of the
    assignment and when listing the assignment on the home page of
    the course in Möbius.</p> 

  <p>The test that you may type in in the section <em>Text to show at
      the head of each page</em> (item <em>8</em> in the figure above) will
    appear at the top of each page of the assignment.  This section is
    very useful when you find out that one of the questions of the
    assignment is broken (this obviously never happens).  The text that
    you post in that section automatically appears at the top of each
    page of the assignment even if students have already started their
    assignment.</p>

  <p>Finally, if you want to write comments to be displayed after the
    students submit their assignments, you may type them in the section
    <em>Text to show on the results page</em> (item <em>9</em> in the
    figure above).</p>
</li>
<li> <p>When you have completed the first tab, you select the second
    tab <em>Select Questions</em> (item <em>10</em> in the figure above
    to get the following display.</p> 
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_13.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the second tab to select the questions">
</div>
<p>There are three options to add questions to your assignment.  We
  right away eliminate one of the them.  If you click on the question
  mark above <em>New Question</em> (item <em>12</em> in the figure
  above), you can start authoring a new question.  Unless you really
  know what you are doing or the question that you plan to ask is very
  elementary, you probably don't want to use this option.  We focus on
  the other two options.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li> <p>To add an existing question, you click on the arrow
    above <em>Import Question</em> (item <em>11</em> in the figure
    above).  You ge a popup window with the <em>Content Repository</em>
    where you can proceed to select the questions that you want from the
    directory <em>Question</em> (item <em>14</em> in the figure
    below).</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_14.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the popup window with the content repository">
</div>
  <p>The procedure to select questions is similar to the procedure
    to preview questions.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>If you click on <em>Question</em> (item <em>14</em> in the
    figure above), and keep on clicking on the subdirectories until
    you get the list of questions that you want, you get a display
    like the following one.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_15.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the content repository with subdirectories
	    of the directory for the questions">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>Let's suppose that you want the questions <em>1.4.8 - solving
      for x - Maple (U)</em>, <em>1.4.10 - Quotient, medium difficulty
      (U)</em> and <em>1.4.13 - Rationalization, sqrt(x), Guided
      (U)</em>.  You only have to check the box on the left of the
    question and click on <em>Import</em> (item <em>15</em> in the
    figure above.  You then go back to the tab <em>Select
      Questions</em>.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_16.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the content repository with subdirectories
	    of the directory for the questions and a list of questions">
</div>
<p>By default, all questions are worth <em>1</em> point each but you
  are free to change it if you consider that a question is worth more
  than the others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> You are probably not done.  You may proceed similarly to add
  questions to your assignment.  There is another option to add
  questions to your assignment that we mentioned at the beginning of
  the presentation of the tab <em>Select Questions</em>.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li> <p>If you click on the folder above <em>New Question Group</em>
    (item <em>13</em> in the first figure about <em>Select
      Questions</em> above) or on the item <em>New Question group</em>
    of the pull down menu <em>Add</em> (See <em>16</em> in the figure
    above), you go back to the tab <em>Select Questions</em> but in a
    restricted mode (the questions are no longer displayed and the
    option <em>New Question Group</em> is gone) as in the following
    display.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_17.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the tab Select Question in the restricted mode">
</div>
<p> You can see the new question <em>Group</em> under the list of
  questions that we have already added.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>You can always add new questions but again we assume that you
    want to add existing questions.  You select either the arrow
    above <em>Import Question</em> or the item <em>Import Question</em>
    under the pull down menu associate to the group
    (item <em>17</em> in the figure above) to get again the
    popup window with the <em>Content Repository</em>.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_18.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of popup window with the Content Repository">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>Again, you click on the <em>Questions<em> and its
	subdirectories to reach the questions that you want to add to
	the group.</p> 
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_19.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the content repository with subdirectories
	    of the directory for the questions and a list of questions">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>Let's suppose that you want the questions <em>2.2.2 -
      Continuity (T)</em>, <em>2.2.3 - Continuity / piecewise
      (T) </em> and <em>2.2.4 - Continuity (T)</em>.  You proceed as
    you did to add questions above.  You check the box to the left of
    each question and click on <em>Import</em> (item <em>19</em> in the
    figure above).  You then go back to the tab <em>Select
      Questions</em>.</p> 
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_20.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the tab Select Question with the new group
	    of questions">
</div>
</li>
<li><p> As you can see in the figure above, the three questions are
    grouped under your question <em>Group</em>.   By default, each
    question is worth <em>1</em> point each and all questions of the
    group will appear in the assignment.  This is probably not you
    intention when creating a group.  It would have been simpler to
    just add the questions if it was what you wanted.  If you
    select <em>Properties</em> (item <em>20</em> in the figure above),
    you get the following popup menu to format your group.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_21.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the popup window with the form to format the
	    group of questions">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>First, you can change the name of your group to something
    other and more informative than <em>Group</em> by modifying the
    field beside <em>Name</em> (item <em>21</em> in the figure above).
    Probably that you want Möbius to select only a subset of questions
    from the three questions that you have added to your group.  Let's
    suppose that you want Möbius to select only one question out of
    the three questions.  You check the box beside <em>Randomly</em>
    (item <em>22</em> in the figure above) and select <em>1</em> from
    the pull down menu (item <em>23</em> in the figure above).
    Finally, you select the number of point for each of the questions
    that will be selected by Möbius in the field beside <em>Allow</em>
    (item <em>24</em> in the figure above.  When you are done, click
    on <em>Save</em> (item <em>25</em> in the figure above).  After
    doing that, you again go back to the tab <em>Select
    Questions</em></p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_22.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the tab Select Question with the new
	    formated group of questions">
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <p>Let's suppose that you have added all the questions that you
    wanted to included in your assignment.  You are now ready to
    define the properties of your assignment: start date, due date,
    ...   You do all that under the tab <em>Properties</em>
    (item <em>26</em> in the figure above).  This tab is a long form
    that is easy to fill in but requires some careful
    explanation.  For this reason, you should read the section
    <script language="javascript">
      buildLinK(Mbs_policy.url_en, Mbs_policy.text_en,"MMathSStat",
      Mbs_policy.id, Mbs_policy.target);
    </script> for all the details.  We assume that you did so and fill
    in the form to meet your needs.  You are ready to save all your work.
    You only have to click on <em>Save & Close</em> (item <em>27</em>
    in the figure below) at the bottom of the tab.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_23.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the bottom of the window to create a question">
</div>
  <p>You can <em>Save & Close</em> at any time and come back later to
    complete your assignment.  You <em>MUST</em> however make sure to
    hide the assignment as it is explained in the section
    <script language="javascript">
      buildLinK(Mbs_policy.url_en, Mbs_policy.text_en,"MMathSStat",
      Mbs_policy.id, Mbs_policy.target);
    </script>.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>After clicking on <em>Save & Close</em>, you get a popup window
    as the following one.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_24.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the popup window with a summary of the assignment">
</div>
  <p>You can review the information about the assignment to make sure
    that it is exactly what you want.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>Finally, after clicking <em>Save & Close</em> (item <em>28</em>
    in the figure above) again to finally end your work.  You than
    return to the <em>Content Repository</em>.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_25.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of Content Repository with the newly created assignment">
</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>In the figure above, you can click on <em>Hide</em>
  (item <em>29</em> in the figure above) to hide the assignment.  Or,
  if the box displays <em>Show</em>, to make the assignment visible.
  Note that visible doesn't mean accessible.  The assignment is
  only accessible between your start and due dates.</p> 

  <p>In the present case, since the assignment is visible, you can see
    it when you go to the home page of the course on Möbius.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_assignment_26.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the home page where we can see the new
       assignment in the list of existing assignments">
</div>
<p> In the present case, it is even accessible because we made it so.</p>
