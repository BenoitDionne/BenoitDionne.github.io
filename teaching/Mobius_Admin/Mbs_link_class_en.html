<h2> Creating a Link to a Class on Möbius </h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p>Before starting to add Möbius assignments to your course on
  BrightSpace, you need to create your course on Möbius and add a link
  in BrightSpace to the homepage of your course on Möbius.</p>

<p>The homepage of your course on Möbius give you access to the tools
  to create questions and assignments.  You may also access the
  existing questions bank and, if there is one, the list of previous
  assignments for your course.  How to use Möbius is not part of this
  section.  For that, consult the site
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_using.url_en, Mbs_using.text_en,"MMathSStat",
    Mbs_using.id, Mbs_using.target);
  </script>.</p>

<div style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%;">
<div class="LOOK">
You must use <em>Chrome</em> as browser (Firefox is no longer
supported by M&ouml;bius).  You must also make sure
that third party cookies are accepted by your browser.   For more
information on allowing third party cookies on your browser, please
consult the site
<script language="javascript">
buildLinK("https://www.digitaled.com/support/help/student/Content/STUD-GEN-FUNCTIONS/Access-using-LMS.htm","Access using an LMS","MMathSStat", "accLMS", "_blank");
</script>.</br>
Note that Apple computers are notoriously problematic because they do
not respect standards.  The browser Safari is to be avoided.</div>

<div class="LOOK">
If you have several courses on BrightSpace using M&ouml;bius,
you <em>MUST NOT</em> access M&ouml;bius from more than one
course at the same time.  Failing to do so may completely confuse
M&ouml;bius.  After having accessed M&ouml;bius from one course to
create of modify an assignment, you must save and quit this assignment
before moving on to work on an assignment for another course. </div>

<h3> Create a Private Module in BrightSpace </h3>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>The first step is to create a module on BrightSpace.  Here, we
    simply added a new item at the bottom of the table of contents (item
    <em>1</em> in the figure below).</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_homepage_1.png" style="width: 300px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the table of contents in BrightSpace">
  </div>
  <p> You get an empty module like the one below.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_homepage_2.png" style="width: 500px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the empty Module in BrightSpace">
</div></li>
<li> <p>To make this module private (i.e. invisible to the students),
    select the icon (item <em>2</em> in the previous image) that looks
    like an spooky eye (at least to the author of this page).  You get the
    following slide button.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_homepage_3.png" style="width: 500px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the slide button to set a module visible or hidden">
  </div>
  <p>Just select the <em>Hidden</em> position for this slide button.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<a name="CreateLink"></a>
<h3> Create Your Course on Möbius and Add a Link to its Homepage on
  Möbius </h3>

<p>It is now time to create your course on Möbius if the system
  administrator has not do so for you, and add a link in BrightSpace
  to the homepage of your course in Möbius.  Both are done
  simultaneously.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li> <p>Select the item <em>Mobius LTI</em> (item <em>5</em> in the
  figure below) under the drop down menu <em>Add Activity</em>
    (item <em>4</em> in the figure below) in your private module.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_homepage_4.png" style="width: 250px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the items under the drop down menu Add Activity">
  </div>
  <p>You get the following popup window.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_homepage_5.png" style="width: 500px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the window to complete the creation of the
	      LTI link to Mobius">
</div></li>
<li><p> To create your new class on Möbius, Click on <em>New Class</em>
    (item <em>14</em> in the figure above). You will get the following
    form to create your course on Möbius.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_homepage_17.png" style="width: 500px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the form to create a course on Möbius">
  </div>
  <p>The only items that you <em>must modify</em> are <em>Who can
      self-enrol into this class?</em> (item <em>15</em> in the figure
    above) and <em>Inherit content from</em> (item <em>16</em> in the
    figure above).   There is no reason to modify any of the other items
    in the form.</p>

  <p>For the item <em>Who can self-enrol into this class?</em>, you
    must select <em>Students with Class Link</em>. This will let your
    students automatically register to your course on Möbius the first
    time that they attempt an assignment.</p>

  <div class="LOOK" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">
    For the item <em>Inherit content from</em>,
    you <em>must select</em> the course code associated
    to the course code of your course.  For instance, if your course
    is <em>MAT1730[A] Calc...</em> as in the figure above, then you
    must select <em>MAT1730</em>.</span>.
    This will give you access to the bank of questions, the previous
    assignments, ...  associated to this course.</div>

  <p>When all that is done, click on <em>Submit</em> (item <em>17</em>
    in the figure above).  You will go back to the window to create the
    link from BrightSpace to the homepage of your course on Möbius.</p> 
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_homepage_18.png" style="width: 500px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the window to complete the creation of the
	 LTI link to Möbius if the course has already been created">
  </div>
  <p>The course under <em>Create a Link to a Class Home Page</em>
    (item <em>18</em> in the figure above) should be the course that you
    have just created.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>Click to <em>Link to Class Home</em> (item <em>19</em> in the
    figure above) to create the link from BrightSpace to the homepage
    of your course on Möbius.</p>
  <!--
      You will get the following warning
      message.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_homepage_9.png" style="width: 400px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the warning message about grades on Mobius">
  </div>
  <p> This warning is about transferring grades from Möbius to
    the <em>Grades</em> section of BrightSpace.
    Basically, <em>never</em> play with the gradebook on Möbius unless
    you know what you are doing.</p>

  <p> Just click on <em>Confirm</em> (item <em>10</em> in the figure
    above).
    -->
  <p>You are sent back to your private module on BrightSpace.
    It now contains the link to the class home page on Möbius.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_homepage_13.png" style="width: 500px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the BrightSpace module with the new item">
  </div>
</li>
<li> <p>This is what you will get when you will click on the
    item <em>Class Home MAT...</em> of your private module.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_homepage_10.png" style="width: 400px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the homepage of the course on Mobius">
  </div>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="CreatPLHP"> Create a Private Link in BrightSpace to the
  Homepage on Möbius </h3>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li> Go back to your private module and select the item
  <em>Edit Properties In-place</em> under the drop down menu beside the title
  of the item <em>Class Home MAT...</em> (item <em>11</em> in the figure
  below).
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_homepage_11.png" style="width: 400px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the private module with the item Class
	      Home MAT ...">
  </div>
  <p>This open an elaborate menu under the title of the item as you
    can see below.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_homepage_12.png" style="width: 500px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the menu associated to the item Edit
	      Properties In-place">
  </div>
</li>
<li> <p>This is the second level of security (uOttawa is strong on
    multi-everything in terms of security, so let's imitate them).
    Click on the spooky eye (item <em>12</em> in the figure above)  to
    get the slide button as before to switch to the <em>Hidden</em>
    mode.   By default, the box beside <em>Open as External
      resource</em> (item <em>13</em> in the figure above) should be
    checked.  You should leave it like that.  It will give you a full
    display of your Class homepage when you access it. </p>
</li>
<li> <p>When all that is done, you have your LTI link to the homepage
    of your course on Möbius.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3> Last Touch (optional) </h3>

<p>There is something else that you may want to do to improve the
  appearance of the course homepage on Möbius.   This is not really
  needed because students <em>Must not use</em> the course homepage on
  Möbius.</p>

<p>To get rid of the long warning message on the course homepage
  (item <em>20</em> in the figure below)</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_homepage_20.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the course homepage on Möbius with the
	    long warning message">
</div>
<p>Click on <em>Class Info</em> (item <em>21</em> in the figure above)
  to get the following class details.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_homepage_21.png" style="width: 400px"
       alt="Screenshot of the class details">
</div>

<p>Click on <em>Edit</em> (item <em>22</em> in the figure above) to get
  the form to edit some of the properties of the class on Möbius.  We
  show below only the bottom of this form.  You should
  <em>not touch</em> any of the previous items on the form.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_homepage_22.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the bottom of the form to edit some of the
	    class details">
</div>

<p>To get rid of the warning message on the homepage, you have to
  write something in the section <em>Class Message</em>.  Adding a
  simple white space will not work.  Möbius is too smart for its own
  good.  If you add a simple white space, Möbius will remove it when
  you save the page assuming that you in fact don't want to write
  anything in the section <em>Class Message</em>.  The simplest thing
  to do is probably to add an horizontal line by clicking on the first
  icon of the second line of the menu (item <em>23</em> in the figure
  above).  After you click on <em>Submit</em> (item <em>24</em> in the
  figure above), the new homepage of your course on Möbius will look
  something like in the following figure.</p>

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_homepage_23.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the course homepage on Möbius with the the
	    horizontal line instead of the large warning message">
</div>

<h2> Appendix </h2>

<div class="LOOK" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">
You <em>should not read</em> this section.  It is used only when the
system administrator has already create a course on Möbius for you.  That
should never happen. </div>

<p> You only need to add a Link to the course homepage on Möbius.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li> <p> After having selected the item <em>Mobius LTI</em> under the
    drop down menu <em>Add Activity</em>, you get the following popup
    window.</p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_homepage_8.png" style="width: 500px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the window to complete the creation of the
	      LTI link to Möbius if the course has already been created">
  </div>
</li>
<li> <p>Select the course on Möbius that you want to link to your
    course on BrightSpace using the drop down menu below
    <em>Create a Link to a Class Home Page</em> (item <em>8</em> in
    the figure above).</p>
</li>
<li> <p>Then click on the button <em>Link to Class Home</em>
    (item <em>9</em> in the figure above).  That is it.  Do not do
    anything else.  After clicking on the button <em>Link to Class Home</em>,
    You are sent back to your private module on BrightSpace.
    It now contains the link to the class home page on Möbius.<p>
</li>
<li> You can proceed to make private the link to the class homepage on
  Möbius as we explained in Section
