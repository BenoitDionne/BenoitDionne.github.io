<h2> Previewing Questions </h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p>We explain how to preview a question from the bank of questions for
  the calculus courses.  The same procedure applies to previewing any
  question in Möbius.</p>

<h3> Procedure </h3>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li> <p>Log in to your course on Möbius.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_preview_1.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the home page of a course on Möbius">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>After accessing the home page for your course, select the item
  <em>Content Repository</em> (item <em>1</em> in the figure above) from the
  top menu to get the following display.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_preview_2.png" style="width: 350px"
       alt="Screenshot of the initial display of the content repository on Möbius">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>Select the item <em>Questions</em> (item <em>2</em> in the figure
  above), to get the list of available questions and directories
  containing questions.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_preview_3.png" style="width: 550px"
       alt="Screenshot of the questions and directories of questions in the content repository on Möbius">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>In the present case, you get 14 directories.  In this example,
  all directories are marked by the green symbol for shared
  directories because they are all inherited from the parent course of
  the present course.  If you want to look at question under
  the <em>integrals</em> directory, it suffices to click on the title
  of the directory (item <em>3</em> in the figure above) to get the
  following display.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_preview_4.png" style="width: 550px"
       alt="Screenshot of the second level of questions and directories of questions in the content repository on Möbius">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>You get another list of directories.  If you want to look at the
  questions about the method of substitution, you only have to click
  on the name <em>Substitution</em> (item <em>4</em> in the figure above)
  which is for the name of the directory contains these
  questions.   You finally get the following display with the
  list of available questions on the desired subject. </p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_preview_5.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the third level of questions and directories of questions in the content repository on Möbius">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>This time, there is no directories but only questions.  As for
  the directories, all questions are marked by the green symbol for
  shared questions because they are all inherited from the parent
  course of the present course.  If you want to preview the
  question <em>5.6.30 - definite ( u = sin(nx) ) (T)</em>, you click
  on its title to get the following display.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_preview_6.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the content repository on Möbius where the information about the selected question appear on the right">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>You get information about the selected question.  The
  section <em>Details</em> (item <em>6</em> in the figure above) should
  be ignored.  The authors of the questions did not bother
  entering the information.  The interesting section
  is <em>Statistics</em> (item <em>7</em> in the figure above)
  where you can find how many students have answered
  this question, how many got it completely right,
  partial right or totally wrong.  This is useful the
  judge the level of difficulty of the question.  The
  easiest way to preview the question is to click on
  the (partial) display of the question.  You will see
  a big Q appear when your moose hovers over the
  (partial) display of the question.  So, if you click
  on the (partial) display of the question, you get
  the a popup window with the question in it.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_preview_7.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the popup window with the selected questiont">
</div>
</li>
<li> <p>After you have entered your answers, you can click on
  <em>How did I do?</em> (item <em>9</em> in the figure above), to ask
  Möbius to tell you if your answers are right.  Each right answer is
  surrounded by a green rectangle and each wrong answer by a red
  rectangle.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_preview_8.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the popup window with the evaluation of your answers after clicking How did I do?">
</div>
<p>Answers to multiple choice questions that require to select many
items, matching questions, Maple Graded questions with partial marks,
... may also be surrounded by a yellow rectangle if the answer in
partially right.  You may return to edit your answers by clicking in
any of the boxes to enter the answers.</p>

<p>If you want to look at the detailed solution of the question, you only
have to click on <em>Grade</em> (item <em>8</em> in the previous two
figures) to obtain the detailed solution.  The question is also
completely graded.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_preview_9.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the popup window with the detailed solution of the question">

<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_preview_10.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the popup window with the detailed solution of the question">
</div>
<p>You can click on <em>back</em> (item <em>12</em> in the previous two
figures) to go back to the popup window with the question.</p>

<p>At any time, you click on <em>Close</em> (item <em>11</em> in the last
four figures) to quit the display and go back to the list of questions
in the content repository.</p>

<p>There is also the possibility to click on <em>Refresh</em>
(item <em>10</em> in the two initial figures above of the popup window
with the question) to request a new version of the question.</p>
