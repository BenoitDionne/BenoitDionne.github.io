<h2> Managing Questions and Assignments </h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p>If you have created your own questions and assignments in a
  previous course and would like to use them in your new course, you
  have to export them from the old course to a zip file and, after
  that, import this zip file to your new course.  We explain how to do
  it below.</p>

<h3> Exporting Questions and Assignments to a zip File </h3>

<p>We explain how to export assignments to a zip file.  The procedure
  is almost identical for questions.   The only difference is to
  select questions instead of assignments.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>In the course where are located the assignments that you will like
    to use in your new course, select <em>Content Repository</em> in the
    top menu  (item <em>1</em> in the figure below) followed
    by <em>Assignments</em> (item <em>2</em> in the figure below).
    Then, select the folder where your assignments can be found.
    Normally, it will be in the folder <em>Default Unit</em>
    (item <em>3</em> in the figure below) but it could be any
    folder.</p>

	 alt="Screenshot of screen displayed after selecting the item
	      content repository">
</div></li>
<li><p>Then, click the boxes in front of the assignments that you want to
    export to a zip file.  In the example above (item <em>4</em> in the
    figure above), we selected all the assignments in the folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, click on the button <em>Export</em> at the bottom of the
    window (item <em>5</em> in the figure above) to export the
    selected assignments to a zip file.  Your file manager will
    probably ask you to confirm that you accept to download the zip
    file to your system.  By default, the name of the zip file will be
    the name of the assignment if you export only one assignment
    or <em>Coursemodule.zip</em> if you export more than one
    assignment.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3> Importing a zip File with Questions and Assignments to a course </h3>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>On the new course, you select <em>Content Repository</em> in
    the top menu (item <em>6</em> in the figure below).  Click
    on <em>Import</em> at the top left-corner of the new display
    (item <em>7</em> in the figure below).</p>
  
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_management_2.png" style="width: 800px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the screen displayed after selecting the
	      item content repository">
  </div>
  <p>You will get the following popup window to select a file on your
    computer.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_management_3.png" style="width: 500px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the popup window after clicking on Import">
</div></li>
<li> <p>Click on <em>Browse</em> in this popup window (item <em>8</em>
    in the figure above) to access the file manager of your computer.
    After you have selected the zip file that you want to import, you
    will go back to the popup window.  This time, the name of the zip
    file that you want to import appear on the left of
    the <em>Browse</em> button (item <em>9</em> in the figure below).
    Click on <em>Import Content</em> on the bottom right corner of the
    popup window (item <em>10</em> in the figure below) to import the
    zip file.</p>
  
  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_management_4.png" style="width: 500px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the popup window after having selected the
	      zip file to import">
  </div>
  <p>You will get the following popup window confirming that the
    transfer has been done successfully if you have selected a proper
    zip file.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_management_5.png" style="width: 500px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the popup window after having successfully
	      imported a zip file">
</div></li>
<li> <p>You may select <em>View the imported content</em>
    (item <em>11</em> in the figure above) or click on <em>Done</em>
    (item <em>12</em> in the figure above).</p>

  <p>The assignments that you have imported will be found in the
    subfolder <em>Default Unit</em> of the <em>Assignments</em> folder of
    the course (item <em>13</em> in the figure below).</p>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Mobius_management_6.png" style="width: 800px"
	 alt="Screenshot of the screen displayed after selecting the
	      item content repository ==> Assignments ==> Default
	      Units">
</div></li>
</ol>

<p>All the questions used for the assignments that you have imported
  can be found in the folder <em>Questions</em>. <!--as can be seen in the
  figure below.-->  They are the questions that you have to edit if
  ever you need to edit the questions of the assignments that you
  have imported.  If your assignments were using questions from
  the database of questions, <em>the imported assignments will not
    use them</em> but will use the imported questions that you can find
  in the folder <em>Questions</em>.</p>

<p>You can now edit the assignments: change the questions, modify the
  access and due dates, etc.</p>
