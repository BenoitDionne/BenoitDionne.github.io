<h2> How to create Adaptive Assignments </h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p>We give a summary of the steps to create an adaptive assignment.
  Most of the steps are identical to those used to create a standard
  assignment.  We will therefore regularly refer to the documents
<script language="javascript">
  buildLinK(Mbs_assign.url_en, Mbs_assign.text_en,"MMathSStat",
  Mbs_assign.id, Mbs_assign.target);
</script> and
<script language="javascript">
  buildLinK(Mbs_policy.url_en, Mbs_policy.text_en,"MMathSStat",
  Mbs_policy.id, Mbs_policy.target);
</script>.</p>

<p>An <em>adaptive assignment</em> is composed of several branches.
  Each branch is of a different level of difficulty.  You select the
  branch that students start with.  Students move to a branch of lower
  of upper level of difficulty according to the policies that you
  set.</p>

<h3> Procedure </h3>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li> <p>As for creating an assignment, you have to access the folder
    under <em>Content repository ==> Assignments</em> where you would
    like to store the adaptive assignment.  Unless you have an
    elaborate hierarchy of assignments, you will probably store your
    assignments in the folder <em>Default Unit</em> (item <em>1</em> in
    the figure bellow).</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_adaptive_1.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the directory Content repository ==> Assignments">
</div>
<p>There is presently no assignment in the folder <em>Default
    Unit</em> depicted above.</p> </li>
<li><p>To begin editing your new adaptive assignment, you have to select
  the item <em>Adaptive Assignment</em> (item <em>2</em> in the figure
  below) that you can find under the pull down menu <em>Create
    New</em> at the bottom of the folder that you have selected.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_adaptive_2.png" style="width: 400px"
       alt="Screenshot of the menu at the bottom of the selected">
</div> </li>
<li> <p>The first tab to create an adaptive assignment is called
    <em>1. Choose name</em> (item <em>3</em> in the figure below) and
    it is identical to the first tab to create a standard assignment.
    A complete description of this tab is given in <em>item 6</em> of
    the procedure to create a standard assignment in
<script language="javascript">
  buildLinK(Mbs_assign.url_en, Mbs_assign.text_en,"MMathSStat",
  Mbs_assign.id, Mbs_assign.target);
</script>.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_adaptive_3.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the first tab to create an adaptive assignments">
</div></li>
<li> <p>The real work to create an adaptive assignment is done under
    the tab <em>2. Select Questions</em> (item <em>4</em> in the figure
    below).  Initially, there is only one branch which is the starting
    branch (item <em>5</em> in the figure below).  Using the drop down
    menu on the right side of the title of the branch, we may import
    questions, create new question and add new question groups to this
    branch.  We will come back to this shortly.  For now, we want to
    mention that you can select the item <em>Properties</em>
    (item <em>6</em> in the figure below) to modify the properties of
    the branch including its title.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_adaptive_4.png" style="width: 500px"
       alt="Screenshot of the second tab to create an adaptive assignments">
</div> </li>
<li> <p>If you select the item <em>properties</em>, you get the
    following popup window.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_adaptive_5.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the second tab to create an adaptive assignments">
</div>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>You may give a name to each branch that you create.</li>
<li>You may select the branch that will be the starting branch.  To
  change the starting branch for the assignment, you have to check the
  box beside <em>Start Branch</em> for the branch that you want to be
  the starting branch.  It is not possible to deselect the
  option <em>Start Branch</em>.   Think of these boxes beside
  the <em>Start Branch</em> options for each branch as radio boxes (for
  those old enough to remember radios in old cars).  There must always
  be one and only one starting branch.</li>
<li>You can assign the weight that each question of this branch will
  have for the computation of the finale grade.  Questions in an easy
  branch may be worth less than questions in a more challenging
  branch.</li> 
<li>You can also select to scramble the questions.  By default the
  question are assigned to the students in the order that they are
  listed in the branch.  If you select this option, the questions are
  scrambled before being assigned to the student.   If all the
  questions of the branch are used before the student exits the
  branch, the questions will be scrambled again before being assigned
  to the student.  If you don't request that questions be scrambled,
  the questions will again be assigned to the student in the exact
  order that they are listed in the branch.  This is repeated as long
  as the student does not exit the branch.</li>
<li>You can request that question be recycled.  If a student needs to
  request more questions than there are in a branch, this option is
  automatically activated (if it was not) with the restriction that
  all questions of the branch must be used before restarting to use
  them.  If this option is selected, the next question assigned to a
  student is chosen from all the question with a chance that the same
  question be repeated.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Do not forget</em> to save you modifications when you are done
  (item <em>7</em> in the figure above).</p>
</li>
<li> <p>To add content to a branch, you may use the drop down menu at
    the right of the title of a branch as we mentioned above or, if
    the branch is selected, you can use the main menu on the right of
    the second tab as illustrated below.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_adaptive_6.png" style="width: 600px"
       alt="Screenshot of the main menu to add questions to an assignment">
</div>
<p>A complete description of the procedure to select questions and
  question groups is given under <em>item 7</em> of the procedure
  to create a standard assignment in
<script language="javascript">
  buildLinK(Mbs_assign.url_en, Mbs_assign.text_en,"MMathSStat",
  Mbs_assign.id, Mbs_assign.target);
</script>.  We will not repeat this procedure here.</p> </li>
<li> <p>To add branches to your assignment, click on the
    button <em>Add Branch</em> at the bottom of
    the <em>Navigation</em> area that you can find on the left margin
    of the second tab (item <em>8</em> in the figure below) and proceed
    as we have done above to build your new branch.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_adaptive_7.png" style="width: 400px"
       alt="Screenshot of the Navigation area that can be found on the
       right margin of the second tab">
</div> </li>
<li> <p>Let's assume that we have all the branches for our assignment
    and that you have selected your starting branch.  It is now time
    to define the policies for transferring from one branch to the
    other.  To define the policies, you have to click on the
    item <em>Policies</em> that you can find above
    the <em>Navigation</em> area on the right margin of the second tab
    (item <em>9</em> in the figure above).</p></li>
<li> <p>After clicking on the item <em>Policies</em>, you get the
    following menu.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_adaptive_8.png" style="width: 700px"
       alt="Screenshot of the menu to set the policies for your
       adaptive assignment">
</div>
<p>There are four sections to this menu.  The first section, <em>Grade
    Assignment When</em>, gives you three options to choose from.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li> Number of <em>Questions Seen<em> (i.e. number of questions
      requested by the student)</li>
<li> Number of <em>Correct Responses<em></li>
<li> Number of <em>Incorrect Responses<em></li>
</ol>

<p>The following rules are applied:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>You can select one or more options.</li>
<li>The first option to be satisfied ends the assignment.  The
  assignment is then graded.</li>
<li>The number of questions in the assignment is the the largest
  number chosen for the selected options.  For instance, if the
  assignment is to end when 10 questions have been seen or 7 correct
  answers have been given, then the assignment will have 10
  questions.</li>
<li>A question is counted as a <em>Correct Response</em> if the
  student get all parts of the question right.  A wrong answer to one
  part of the question implies that the full question is counted as
  an <em>Incorrect response</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second section, <em>Grade Policy</em>, offers three options.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li> <em>Basic<em> </li>
<li> <em>ELO<em> </li>
<li> <em>Algorithmic<em> </li>
</ol>

<p>For the <em>Basic</em> option, the assignment is graded based on
  the weight that you have assigned to each question of each branch.
  The <em>ELO</em> policy is <q lang="en">a method for calculating the
    relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games</q> (consult
  the sites <script language="javascript">
  buildLinK("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system",
  "ELO rating System","MMathSStat", "ELO1", "_blank");
  </script> and
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK("https://digitaled.com/support/help/instructor/Content/INST-ACTIVITIES/ASSIGNMENTS/Adaptive-assignment-policies.htm?Highlight=adaptive",
  "Work with adaptive assignment policies","MMathSStat", "ELO2", "_blank");
  </script> formor einformation).  If you select the
  option <em>Algorithmic</em>, then the option <em>Algorithmic</em> in
  the following section of the menu is automatically selected.  You
  then have to create an algorithm that end with the
  command <em>returnGrade(N)</em>, where N is the grade computed
  according to your algorithm.  We will address the
  option <em>Algorithmic</em> in a section
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK("#AlgorithmicPolicies","Algorithmic Policies","MMathSStat",
    "algoP", "_top");
  </script> below.</p>

<p>The third section of the menu is <em>Adaptive Policy</em> and
  offers two options.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li> <em>Basic<em> </li>
<li> <em>Algorithmic<em> </li>
</ol>

<p>The <em>Basic</em> option (default) gives you the menu in the
  fourth and last section of the menu.  This is the one that we will
  describe right now.  The option <em>Algorithmic</em> will be the
  subject of the section
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK("#AlgorithmicPolicies","Algorithmic Policies","MMathSStat",
    "algoP", "_top");
  </script> below.</p>

<p>You have the option to transfer a student to the next higher level
  of difficulty if the student answers correctly a certain number of
  questions (consecutively or non-consecutively according to your
  choice), or to transfer a student to the level of difficulty below
  if the student fails to answer correctly a certain number of
  questions (again consecutively or non-consecutively according to
  your choice).</p>

<p>If there are not enough questions in a branch to meet the
  requirements to transfer to another branch, questions are repeated.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>Use the button <em>Back</em> on the top left corner of the tab
    (item <em>10</em> in the previous figure) to go back to the full
    tab <em>2. Select Questions</em>.  There is no <em>save</em>
    required at this time.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>To complete the adaptive assignment, you have to add the
    properties.  Will the assignment be graded?  What will be the
    deadline to submit the assignment?  Etc. To do so, select the
    third tab, the tab entitled <em>Properties</em> (item <em>11</em> in
    the figure below).</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_adaptive_9.png" style="width: 400px"
       alt="Screenshot of the top part of the window to create an
       adaptive assignment">
</div> </li>
<li> <p>The tab <em>Properties</em> for the adaptive assignments is
    almost identical to the tab <em>Properties</em> that is described
    on the site	<script language="javascript">
      buildLinK(Mbs_policy.url_en, Mbs_policy.text_en,"MMathSStat",
      Mbs_policy.id, Mbs_policy.target);
</script> for the standard assignments.  As for the
    tab <em>Policies</em> for the standard assignments, the
    tab <em>Policies</em> for the adaptive assignments contains the
    mains sections: <em>Types of Assignments</em>, <em>Policy
      Set</em>, <em>Scheduling and Visibility</em>, <em>Feedback
      (After)</em>, <em>Reporting</em> and
    <em>IP Address/Host Names Whitelist</em>.  The main differences
    are that the main section <em>General Properties</em> in
    the standard assignment is not present for the adaptive
    assignments, and there is one additional main section for the
    adaptive assignments called <em>Feedback (During)</em>
    (item <em>12</em> in the figure below).</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_adaptive_10.png" style="width: 800px"
       alt="Screenshot of the entire tab Properties to create an
       adaptive assignment">
</div>
<p>There is a little difference between the main section
  <em>Types of Assignments</em> for the adaptive and standard
  assignments.  For the adaptive assignment, there is no
  option <em>Mastery Dialog</em> and <em>Study Session Dialog</em>.
  All the other common main sections of the adaptive and standard
  assignments are identical.  We refer the reader to the document
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK(Mbs_policy.url_en, Mbs_policy.text_en,"MMathSStat",
    Mbs_policy.id, Mbs_policy.target);
  </script> for the detailed instructions.</p>

<p>The new main section <em>Feedback (During)</em> (item <em>12</em> in
  the figure above) is really short.  You can activate this option to
  provide feedback to the students during their assignment.   They get
  a little table at the top of their assignment that shows their
  progress: on which branch of the assignment they are, the question
  that they got right and those they got wrong so far, and the number
  of questions answered.</p>
<div class="center">
  <img src="Mobius_adaptive_12.png" style="width: 400px"
       alt="Screenshot of the table displayed at the top of the page
       during the assignment">
</div>
<p>After submitting their assignment, students get a detailed summary
 of their results that includes the list of questions answered
 correctly and incorrectly for each branch, their rough score for each
 branch and their final score computed according to the algorithm
 selected by the instructor.  In the figure below, the algorithm used
 is the one presented in the
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK("#Example1","first example","MMathSStat",
    "firstOne", "_top");
  </script> below.</p>

</ul>

<a name="AlgorithmicPolicies"></a>
<h3> Algorithmic Policies</h3>

<p>You may create a Maple algorithm to choose the branch from which
  the next question should be drawn from and, possibly, to determine
  when an assignment will end.</p>

<p>The algorithm must return one of the following three values:</p>

<ul>
<li> The number of the next branch to draw the question from.  The
  end of the assignment is determined by the conditions that you have selected
  in the first section of the menu for the <em>Policies</em>.</li>
<li> The variable <font class="matlab">GRADE</font>.  This will end
  the assignment and compute the final grade according to the weight
  that you have associated to the questions of each branch.</li>
<li> A call to the procedure
  <font class="matlab">returnGrade(N)</font>, where N is the
  final grade for the assignment computed according to your algorithm.
  As stated previously, this procedure must be used when the
  option <em>Algorithmic</em> is selected for grading the assignment in
  the second section of the menu for the <em>Policies</em>. </li>
</ul>

<p>To create an algorithm, you may use one of the following variable:</p>

<div class="center" style="width: 100%">
<table style="width: 90%;">

</div>

<p>If an error occurs, the system will use the <em>basic</em> policy
  to choose the next branch.</p>

<a name="Example1"></a>
<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>This example is from <em>DigitalEd</em>.  In this example, the assignment
  has 12 questions and three branches: easy, medium and difficult.
  The final score for the assignment is one less than the number of
  the branch where the next question would have come from.  The
  assignment may end before 12 questions are drawn if the student
  answers incorrectly two consecutive questions drawn from the branch
  associated to the lowest level of difficulty.   The student then get
  0 for the assignment (one less than the branch 1 that should have
  been the next branch used.)  The assignment also ends before 12
  questions are drawn if the student answers correctly two consecutive
  questions drawn from the branch associated to the highest level of
  difficulty.  The student then get the maximal
  score <font class="matlab">num_branches</font> for the assignment
  (one less than the fictional
  branch <font class="matlab">num_branches + 1</font> that should have
  been the next branch used.)</p>

<p>After two consecutive right answers, students are bumped up to the
  branch just above the current branch.  After two consecutive wrong
  answers, students are dropped to the branch just below the current
  branch.</p> 

<p>It is not given by the algorithm but we may assume that students
  start at the lowest level and their goal is to end as the highest
  level as possible.</p>

<pre class="matlab">
<font class="matlab">
nextBranch := current_branch:
if abs(streak) >= 2 and response_branches[seen-2+1] = current_branch then
    nextBranch := current_branch + signum(streak):
end if:
score := max(0, nextBranch - 1):
if nextBranch >= 1 and nextBranch <= num_branches and seen<12 then
    nextBranch, score;
else
    returnGrade(score);
end if;
</font>
</pre>

<p>For the first test, we verify first if we have two consecutive
  right answers or two consecutive wrong answer.  If we have a
  consecutive sequence of two right (wrong) answers, then we check
  that these two consecutive right (wrong) answers come from the same
  branch.  For that, we only have to check that the first question in
  the consecutive sequence considered comes from the same branch than
  the current question.  The student could not have moved to another
  branch and come back to the initial branch during the consecutive
  sequence presently considered because that would have required at
  least two consecutive sequences, one of right answers and one of
  wrong answers, in total longer than the consecutive sequence
  presently considered.  If all the conditions are satisfied, the next
  question will be drawn from the branch which is one up
  if <font class="matlab">streak</font> is positive or one lest
  is <fontn class="matlab">streak</font> is negative.</p>

<p>For the second test, we verify if the student can request another
  question.  If the students does not have two consecutive wrong
  answers at the lowest level of difficulty
  (i.e. <font class="matlab">nextBranch < 1</font>) or two consecutive
  right answers at the highest level of difficulty
  (i.e. <font class="matlab">nextBranch > num_branches</font>), and
  has requested less than 12 questions, then the student can request
  another question.  Otherwise, the assignment ends.</p>

<p>In the code above, the current score is also returned with the
  number of the next branch (see the
  line <font class="matlab">nextBranch, score;</font>).  This score is
  used when the option <em>Show Current Grade</em> of the <em>Policy
  Set</em> of this assignment has been 	selected.</p> 

<h4> Example 2 </h4>

<p>The following example was inspired by an example given in the
  document
  <script language="javascript">
    buildLinK("http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~pkates/mobius/adaptive-assignment-mobius-integration.html","Mobius Adaptive Assignment","MMathSStat",
    "MAAlink", "_blanck");
  </script>.</p>

<p>This assignment has four branches.  Students should answer
  correctly 3 consecutive questions from the first branch and 3
  consecutive questions from the third branch to get the maximal
  score.   Students can request no more than 20 questions to do that.
  Students start in the first branch and are transferred to the third
  branch only after having answered correctly 3 consecutive questions
  from the first branch.</p>

<p>Students are transferred to the second branch if they fail to
  answer correctly 2 consecutive questions in the first branch.   It
  is assumed that questions in the second branch are easier than those
  in the first branch and help students prepare for the questions in
  the first branch.  Students are transferred back to the first branch
  after having answering correctly 3 consecutive questions from the
  second branch.</p>

<p>Similarly, students are transferred to the fourth branch if they
  fail to answer correctly 2 consecutive questions in the third
  branch.  It is assumed that questions in the fourth branch are
  easier than those in the third branch and help students prepare for
  the questions in the third branch.  Students are transferred back to
  the third branch after having answering correctly 3 consecutive
  questions from the fourth branch.</p> 

<p>Students get 1 point for each question answered correctly in the
  first branch unless they answer correctly 3 consecutive questions in
  which case they automatically get 20 points and are transferred to
  the third branch.   Students get 2 point for each question answered
  correctly in the third branch unless they answer correctly 3
  consecutive questions in which case they automatically get an extra
  40 points and the assignment ends.  There is no point given from
  correctly answering questions in the second and fourth
  branch.   <em>This marking scheme may not be pedagogically good but
    it is amusing for the author.</em></p>

<p>The following figure displays the policies adopted for this example.</p>
